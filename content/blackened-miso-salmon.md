Blackened Miso Salmon with Creamy Coconut Cucumber Salad… Sweet and salty broiled (or air fried) salmon with a crispy caramelized top and tender interior. The cucumber salad is light and fresh with coconut milk and asian flavors. All served over black rice for am easy, delicious meal in less than 40 minutes.

How to Make Miso **Blackened** Salmon
-------------------------------------

This Blackened Miso Salmon is super simple, all you do is marinate the fish on the counter for about 15-20 minutes then pop it under the broiler for about 10 minutes.

The marinade is a blend of soy sauce, honey, miso and lime juice. It’s the perfect marinade, but also a great sauce for drizzling over the fish once it’s cooked, so **reserve about 1/4 cup before adding the fish!**

Once the salmon has absorbed some of those delicious flavors, turn on the broiler and place an oven rack about six inches below the heating element. This prevents the salmon from burning or even catching fire. To cook the salmon, I used a broil pan but a foil lined baking sheet would work too.

Remember to keep a close eye on the salmon while it’s under the broiler. Due to the salmon’s proximity to the heat, the sugars from the honey and miso will caramelize, while the inside stays nice and tender. Everyone’s oven is a little bit different so you want to watch out for burning. Even though this salmon is meant to be “blackened,” you just want a little color around the edges, truly burnt fish will be bitter.

Serve the Blackened Miso Salmon fresh out of the oven with a drizzle of that reserved marinade. I like to remove the skin before plating but do whatever you like!

This Miso Blackened Salmon also tastes delicious when cooked in the air fryer. The method is very similar to the broiler. Just place your salmon filets in the basket of the air fryer and cook for about 5 minutes. Brush over some of the remaining marinade and air fry for an additional 2-4 minutes or until the salmon is cooked to your liking.

Creamy **Coconut** **Cucumber** Salad
-------------------------------------

The Blackened Miso Salmon will take about 15 minutes to marinate, so that’s the perfect amount of time to make the Coconut Cucumber Salad!

This salad was inspired by those heavy cucumber salads made with sour cream and dill. This one uses coconut milk instead, so it’s a little lighter, dairy free and (in my opinion) more flavorful. Make sure to use full fat, unsweetened coconut milk. This is going to make the salad super creamy and rich.

Very straightforward to make, just slice your cucumber, chop the scallions and a little cilantro. Toss everything together in a large bowl with the coconut milk, lime juice and lime zest before tasting and adding salt. This type of coconut milk has a tendency to separate, so be sure to shake the can before opening. The salad can sit at room temperature while the salmon cooks or be refrigerated and made in advance.

Tips For **Serving**
--------------------

I served my Blackened Miso Salmon and cucumber salad over some black rice, also called “Forbidden Rice.” It goes perfectly with these flavors if you can find it. If not, cook up some short grain brown or white rice instead.

I also added a sprinkle of red chili flakes over the whole dish for a bit of heat. This is optional, but it does go really nicely with the coolness from the cucumber salad.
