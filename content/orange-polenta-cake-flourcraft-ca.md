### Instructions

1 Preheat the oven to 325°F. Spray an 8-inch round cake pan with cooking spray and line the bottom with a parchment circle. Spray the parchment circle with cooking spray as well.

2 In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the soft butter and sugar on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy and pale in color, about 3 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, and mix on low speed, scraping down the bowl between additions. Add orange zest and vanilla and mix until all the ingredients are well combined.

3 Add almond meal, instant polenta, baking powder, salt, and xanthan gum to the mixer bowl and mix on medium speed, stopping the mixer to scrape down the bowl once or twice, until the batter is creamy and pale in color, about 2-3 minutes.

4 Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and, using a small offset spatula or rubber spatula, smooth out the top and spread the batter all the way to the sides of the pan.

5 Bake for 40-45 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through baking, until the top of the cake is evenly golden brown and feels set.

When finished the cake will just start to pull away from the sides of the pan but will feel still somewhat soft when pressed gently in the center.

6 Let cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. In the meantime, make the bittersweet chocolate ganache. When the cake has cooled, invert it onto a pedestal or platter and remove the parchment circle.

7 To apply the ganache, start with a 3-inch wide dollop of warm, pourable ganache in the center of the cooled cake. Use the back of a spoon or an offset spatula to spread the ganache almost to the edge of the cake, without going over the sides. Allow the ganache to set before slicing the cake.

The cake will keep, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, in the refrigerator up to 3 days.
