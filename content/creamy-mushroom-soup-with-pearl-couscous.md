Mushroom & Couscous Soup Ingredients:
-------------------------------------

*   **Butter**\- salted or unsalted
*   **Shallot**\- minced. Can you substitute onions? Yes! However keep in mind that shallots are more delicate in flavor, a bit sweeter and less intense than regular onion.
*   **Garlic**\- minced.
*   **Baby Bella Mushrooms**\- baby bella mushrooms are earthier and meatier than white button mushrooms, making them a perfect pairing with richer flavors.
*   **Beef Broth**\- beef broth has a strong, rich, robust flavor making it a great match for mushrooms. If you'd like to make this vegetarian, you can substitute vegetable broth.
*   **White Wine**\- this is important! White wine adds acidity to the soup which really brings out the flavors. If you'd like to substitute the wine, try a splash of white wine vinegar instead.
*   **Worcestershire Sauce**\- to deepen the flavor.
*   **Spices-** Salt, pepper, dried dill, paprika, and dried thyme
*   **Pearl Couscous or Israeli Couscous**\- Pearl couscous is much bigger than regular couscous with a soft, chewy mouth feel. They are very hearty, perfect for a cozy soup or stew. If you are unable to pearl couscous, it can be substituted with a small pasta such as orzo or ditalini.
*   **Half and Half**\- half and half is a mixture of half whole milk and half cream, and can be found in the coffee creamer section of most grocery stores. It's lighter and has less fat than regular cream.
*   **Sour cream**\- for garnish and a nice contrast to the robust flavors of the soup.
*   **Crusty Bread**\- for serving

How To Make Soup Vegetarian:
----------------------------

For vegetarian soup, substitute beef broth with vegetable broth. To make vegan, replace butter with olive oil. Coconut milk can be used in place of half & half. It will give your soup a bit more sweetness, but is a nice contrast to the more savory flavors.

How to Serve Creamy Mushroom & Couscous Soup:
---------------------------------------------

*   This soup is hearty enough to be eaten on it's own, but crusty bread is always a good idea!

*   **Cook Vegetables**: Add butter to a large pot over medium heat. Allow to melt, but not brown. Add sliced baby bella mushroom, minced shallot, & minced garlic to pot. Cook and stir for 2 minutes until aromatic.

*   **Add Seasoning, Broth, and Couscous**: Sprinkle dried dill, dried thyme, and paprika into pot and stir. Whisk in Worcestershire sauce, white wine, and beef broth. Taste and season with salt & pepper. Bring pot to a boil, pour in couscous, and cover pot with a lid. Turn heat down to medium and simmer for 20 minutes.

Leftovers:

Once ready to cook, allow to thaw, add to large pot and continue with recipe.

*   **Reheat**\-reheat soup in a saucepan over low heat. Stir and simmer until warmed through.
