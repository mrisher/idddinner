3 tbsp dijon

Diced half an onion to start the roux

Lower layer of sausage/mushroom

2 cups gruyere, 1.25 sharp cheddar, a few bits of brie

Herbs, cayenne

*   Review: sausage/mushrooms was a bit too brown, umami in the mac and cheese. Didn’t quite work. Kids didn’t like onions (ayumi) or mushrooms (shinji). The onions did well, I thought.

I used Kilkenny cheddar and Gruyere 50/50

Eli comments: used 1.5 times macaroni but kept everything else the same; used fork to break apart lumps, added 1/2 milk first and roux came out great. Mistakenly added mustard, etc., cheese before remembering the other half of the milk. Seemed to be OK. 3 tbsp mustard this time, triple herbs, double garlic.

Puneet comments: topping is overrated.

Added 2/3 extra tbsp Dijon, could still use more

Mixed in fully roasted broccoli 2 cups and chicken 1-cup, worked well.

Could cut down cheese mix by about 1/3

Could use double the garlic and nutmeg and herbs

Because Cara is allergic, I haven't made it in a while so I really need to check my cookbook (which is in a box somewhere). This one is the closest that I could find to the one that I make that I could find online (though mine has a diced onion in the roux and no herbs or cayenne).

A few notes:

*   Do all the prep (e.g. shredding of cheese) ahead of time. MUCH lower stress as timing is important.
*   I use more Gruyere than Cheddar (at least 3:1) and I sometimes swap in some blue cheese for ~1/8 of the total
*   Pasta  
    Salt the pasta water generously before the pasta goes in (unsalted pasta tastes off)Be vigilant with the pasta when you boil it. Set a timer. It should not be hard, but slightly underdone is better than over (it will bake a bit more in the oven)
*   The butter is there for a reason.  
    Don't let Eli sub it with hippie yogurt or whatever.
*   Mustard is also very important (doesn't seem like it, but it is)
*   Herbs and cayenne you can skip if you don't have them (I never use them)
*   The second paragraph is making a roux.  
    Once you've done it once, it will make sense, but notes for the first time:What you are trying to do is make a goey binder to blend the cheese and mac together. It's a slow cooking thing. At the end it should have the consistency of 7-Eleven hot nacho cheese sauce or oatmeal (but w/o any chunks).When you add the flour, it will seem to congeal hardcore - keep whisking it for a few min (they say 2) to get it to bind as much as you can before you start with the milk.Because I only have 2 hands, I find it impossible to have "a constant stream of milk" and hold the bowl and whisk all at the same time, so I add a splash of milk, like ~1/8 cup and then get back to whisking until it congeals and needs more - you're not whipping it, just controlling the congealing as it cooks
*   Topping: I don't make one  
    If you like it to be crusty, at the end, flick the broiler on for the last 5 min (be careful it will burn easily)There is a restaurant in town that tops theirs with an onion ring, which is genius

Ultimate Macaroni and Cheese

If comfort food is what you're after, nothing beats a generous helping of creamy, oozy mac and cheese. This recipe is the yummiest version – and the only one you'll ever need.

Preparation

In large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente. Drain; set aside.

Meanwhile, in large saucepan, melt butter over medium heat; cook garlic and thyme, stirring occasionally, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Whisk in flour; cook, whisking constantly, for 2 minutes. Pour in milk in slow steady stream, whiskingconstantly until smooth; cook, whisking often, until thickened, about 7 minutes. Whisk in mustard, nutmeg, salt, pepper and cayenne pepper. Stir in Gruyère and Cheddar cheeses until smooth; stir in pasta. Scrape into lightly greased 12-cup (3 L) casserole dish.

Topping: In bowl, combine panko with Parmesan cheese; using fingers, rub in butter until mixture resembles coarse sand. Sprinkle over pasta mixture.

Bake in 400 F (200 C) oven until sauce is bubbly and topping is golden, about 25 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.

Tip from the Test Kitchen: The sauce might seem a little runny at first, but it will thicken beautifully when baked with the starchy macaroni.
