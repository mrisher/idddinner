Za’atar has a fragrant aroma with an earthy and slightly nutty flavor.

It adds a unique depth to the grilled chicken and the [creamy](https://cookplatefork.com/2024/02/05/creamy-avocado-cilantro-lime-dressing/) tangy garlic [yogurt](https://cookplatefork.com/2015/10/15/homemade-yogurt/) sauce that accompanies the dish is refreshing against the warm spices.

#### **For the Garlic Yogurt**

1 cup plain Greek yogurt

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 tablespoon lemon juice

Salt to taste

#### Garnishes

1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves, chopped

2 small lemons, cut into wedges

* * *

### **Cook’s Notes**

Za’atar is a Middle Eastern spice blend usually made of [thyme](https://cookplatefork.com/2022/10/14/cooking-with-thyme-includes-recipes/), [sesame](https://cookplatefork.com/2022/02/18/sesame-roasted-orange-chicken-thighs/) seeds, sumac, and sometimes other herbs. You can find it in your local Middle Eastern markets or online.

* * *

#### **Marinate the Chicken**

In a bowl, mix the za’atar, olive oil, [lemon](https://cookplatefork.com/2022/06/27/the-many-uses-of-a-lemon/) juice, salt, and pepper to form a rub.

* * *

Coat the [chicken breasts](https://cookplatefork.com/2016/04/23/cooking-with-chicken-breasts/) evenly with the seasoning rub. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours for more flavor.

#### **Prepare the Garlic Yogurt**

In a small bowl, combine the [Greek yogurt](https://cookplatefork.com/2023/07/10/greek-yogurt-dill-spread-with-ham-and-red-cabbage-on-crisp-bread/), minced garlic, lemon juice, and salt. Mix well and refrigerate until ready to serve.

#### **Grill the Chicken**

Preheat your grill to about 300 degrees, equal to medium-high heat.

* * *

* * *

Grill the [chicken](https://cookplatefork.com/2022/04/19/chicken-in-peanut-coconut-sauce-with-peppers-red-onion/) for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until fully cooked and the internal temperature reaches 165 degrees.

Remove from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes.

#### **Serve**

Place grilled chicken on a platter and drizzle with the garlic yogurt sauce and garnish with chopped [cilantro](https://cookplatefork.com/2024/08/13/cilantro-lime-rice/) and lemon wedges.
