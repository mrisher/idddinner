Usha’s Chole

1/15/2019

came out pretty well, just cooked in large dutch oven, not slow cooker

the longer you leave it the more it mellows and starts to break apart.

two medium onions, finely chopped

three cans chick-peas (about four cups)

1.5 tsp cumin seeds

2 tsp coriander

1/2 tsp black pepper

pinch of cinammon powder

pinch of clove powder or cloves

1 1/2 tsp of salt (taste)

2 tsp of channa masala

1.5 tsp tamarind paste -- get the right color

ginger?

in a big cast iron

3 tbsp oil, sautee onions

add cumin, coriander and cook for a few minutes while stirring

add black pepper, cinammon, clove, repeat

add the drained chickpeas and stir

add salt, tamarind

add 1 cup of water

let it boil for 5 minutes

then...

put it in a slow-cooker 6-7 hours (with water)

or let it cook in cast-iron on simmer for hours, stirring and adding water occasionally until the flavors blend

when it is done, garnish with tomatoes and onions
