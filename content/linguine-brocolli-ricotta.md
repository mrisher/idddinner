The broiler is an unsung kitchen hero because it imparts a flavorful char in half the time that grilling takes. In this 20-minute recipe, kale, broccoli and chickpeas crisp under the broiler while the pasta water boils. Make sure to spread out the vegetables and chickpeas so they have room to caramelize properly instead of steaming (the more crunchy bits, the better). Finish by tossing the pasta and vegetables with a quick sauce of butter, lemon zest and fresh ricotta, a rich and creamy complement to the charred vegetables. Enjoy with crusty bread, good wine and a sense of accomplishment — you just got dinner on the table in under a half hour.

1.  Step
    
    1
    
    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water, and drain the pasta.
    
2.  Step
    
    2
    
    Meanwhile, heat the broiler and set a rack roughly 8 inches from the heat source. In a large bowl, toss the broccoli, chickpeas, garlic, red-pepper flakes and ⅓ cup oil until evenly coated. Season with salt and pepper. Spread out evenly on one sheet pan. Add the kale to the same bowl, and toss to coat in any residual oil. Drizzle with more oil as needed and toss to coat evenly. Spread out in an even layer on the second sheet pan.
    
3.  Step
    
    3
    
    Working with 1 sheet pan at a time, broil the broccoli and chickpeas, tossing halfway through cooking, until the chickpeas are toasty and the broccoli is tender and charred, 5 to 7 minutes. Broil the kale until just charred and crisp, about 5 minutes.
    
4.  Step
    
    4
    
    Zest the lemon, halve it, then cut 1 half into 4 wedges. Squeeze the juice from the lemon half over the roasted vegetables and season to taste with salt and pepper.
    
5.  Step
    
    5
    
    Return the pasta to the pot. Add the ¼ cup reserved pasta cooking water, the ricotta, butter and lemon zest and toss until well combined. Add the roasted vegetables and toss, adding more pasta water as needed.
    
6.  Step
    
    6
    
    Divide among four bowls. Season with flaky sea salt and pepper, and serve with lemon wedges for squeezing on top. Drizzle with more oil, if desired.

I cooked this last night and it was a big hit, although next time I will make two small modifications. First I will broil the Chickpeas apart from the Broccoli and Kale. The Chickpeas require longer under heat to crisp, and that much time will positively cremate the greens. The other small change is to halve the ricotta, 8 ounces was a little much and dulled the flavor of the lemon splashed veggies.

Hi guys! We hear you: We read your notes, and we've adjusted the recipe so that the vegetables are cooked on separate pans. The ricotta is also added earlier, so that should help those who had trouble stirring everything together. I hope this helps!

P.S. No One makes 12 oz of dried pasta rather than the entire box of 16 oz. The standard has always been 16 oz feeds four persons as a main course.

Promises more than it delivers. Next time I will sauté lots of thin slivers of garlic, and hold them aside for a topping with flaky sea salt. I will either leave out the delicious kale chips, or just sauté baby kale leaves with the garlic and EVOO. I will - and did - let the ricotta come to room temp before using. I will use a very generous amount of lemon juice which this recipe needs to keep it from tumbling over the Cliff of Blandness. I will also leave more than 20 minutes to cook.

Absolutely delicious! My personal hacks: No kale on hand. Subbed w/sautéed & seasoned spinach, added back at Step 5. My wife & I are vegan, so I used my own recipe for non-dairy ricotta. Spot on texture and flavor. Red pepper flakes added as a topper when plated; I prefer chili crisp in the mix (Step 2). Used rice noodle linguine, 16 oz, and rescaled all proportions. Texture was more crumbly than creamy, which I prefer. Salt flake topper makes the flavors pop. Can't wait to taste the leftovers!

I don't consume dairy, so ricotta and butter were out. I roasted the chickpeas at 400 for about twenty minutes, and the broccoli on another sheet pan with the garlic, red pepper flakes (and added a few oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes) for about 15 minutes. I didn't have kale. I added a bit of plant "butter" and nutritional yeast for some "cheesiness". All in all, very satisfying.

Hi @Linda! We don’t do dairy either. I often make my own ricotta as well as other vegan cheeses. My 1st Gen Italian mother made her own ricotta and pastas, so I grew up on those flavors. Here’s my easy recipe for a nut-free vegan ricotta w/vegan cream cheese. This imitation ricotta would make Mamma proud! 1 block (14-15 oz) x/firm tofu, drained & gently pressed. 6 oz vegan unsweetened cream cheese. 2 tbsp lemon juice. 1 tsp ea, salt, garlic powder, Italian seasonings, plus more to taste. ¾ tsp Nooch, plus more to taste. Combine ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Mix & mash with a fork to desired consistency. For creamier ricotta add a tbsp room temp water, up to 3 tbsp. Adjust lemon juice & seasonings to taste. Use immediately, or store in fridge up to 5 days. I use this ricotta in many things: manicotti, lasagna, etc. Makes a great topper on salads, too.
