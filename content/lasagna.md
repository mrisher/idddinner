_Learn our easy lasagna recipe with no boil noodles! This classic recipe uses two meats and three cheeses for amazing flavor. Your favorite store-bought spaghetti sauce keeps it simple_.

About two years ago we shared our family’s best lasagna recipe. It is 100% homemade (ok not the pasta, but the rest is homemade). It takes a little work, but it is so good and so worth it.

Lasagna with Ricotta or Cottage Cheese?
---------------------------------------

When I was growing up, I always had lasagna with cottage cheese. I didn’t love the texture of ricotta so my mom always put cottage cheese in lasagna instead.

These days I’m more tolerant of ricotta in lasagna. You can **_use either cottage cheese OR ricotta_** in this recipe. Use the same amount for either cheese you choose to use in this no boil pasta lasagna. You can even mix cottage cheese and ricotta cheese together. Both are delicious, but ricotta is more authentic.

This same thing applies to our [baked rigatoni with sausage and mozzarella](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/baked-rigatoni-and-sausage/)!

Ingredients for Lasagna
-----------------------

This no boil pasta lasagna has simple ingredients, most of which are pantry staples. 

![ingredients for easy lasagna on a table](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ingredients-for-easy-lasagna-recipe.jpg)

**A few notes:**

*   **Ground beef and Italian sausage**. A combination of these two meats give the best flavor. You can season ground pork with our [homemade Italian sausage seasoning](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/homemade-italian-sausage-seasoning/) if you prefer. 
*   **Spaghetti sauce**. This is excellent with a store-bought sauce such as Rao’s marinara or try our [homemade spaghetti sauce](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/healthy-homemade-spaghetti-sauce/). I also use Rao’s in my [pizza pasta casserole](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/pizza-pasta-bake/).
*   **Lasagna noodles**. Can you use the dry lasagna noodles without boiling? Yes! We don’t even specifically use oven-ready noodles. Just use [regular lasagna noodles](https://amzn.to/3HV6njm) and they should cook just fine if you follow our instructions.

**How to Make this Easy Lasagna** Recipe
----------------------------------------

*   In a large skillet over medium heat **brown the ground beef and sausage together**. Drain off and discard any fat. **Add the minced garlic and spaghetti sauce**. Simmer for 5 minutes.

![browned meat with garlic and spaghetti sauce over the top](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/easy-lasagna-recipe_-3.jpg)

2.  In a large bowl, **mix together the cheese mixture**: ricotta cheese, 2 cups of the mozzarella cheese, eggs, ½ cup of grated Parmesan cheese, dried parsley, salt and ground black pepper. Mix well.

![cheese mixture for lasagna in a bowl](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/easy-lasagna-recipe_-4.jpg)

3.  **To assemble**, spread ¾ cup of sauce on the bottom of the baking pan. Cover the bottom with 3 uncooked lasagna noodles. Top with ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture and ¼ of the sauce. **Repeat layers** (noodles, cheese, sauce, noodles, cheese, sauce).
4.  **For the top layer**, add 3 noodles, remaining sauce, remaining 1 cup mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.

![collage of how to layer lasagna](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lasagna-collage-1200x1200.jpg)

5.  Spray a sheet of aluminum foil with cooking spray. **Cover with the pan** with aluminum foil (sprayed side down). This prevents the cheese from sticking. **Bake in the preheated oven for 50 minutes. Uncover and bake an additional 10 minutes.** 
6.  **Let the lasagna stand for 10 minutes** before cutting and serving.

### Pro tip

If your pasta sauce is a thick, hearty sauce, add ½ cup water to the edges of the pan. If your sauce is runnier like Old World Style Ragu or even Rao’s marinara sauce, you won’t need as much water.

**How to Reheat Lasagna**
-------------------------

If you are wanting to heat leftover lasagna that is in a pan, cover it with foil and bake it in an oven that you’ve preheated to 350º Fahrenheit. Bake it until the internal temperature reaches 165º F. This will take at least 30 minutes, but depending on how much is left, could take up to 50 minutes.

You can also reheat individual slices on a plate in the microwave.

**Can you freeze lasagna?**
---------------------------

Yes! You can freeze this easy lasagna recipe both before and/or after you cook it. Here are a few tips:

*   **Use a disposable aluminum pan** to make your lasagna in. Then you can easily wrap the unbaked lasagna and freeze it.
*   If you are baking the lasagna before freezing it, **allow the lasagna to cool completely before wrapping it**.
*   **Wrap the lasagna twice in plastic wrap and once in foil**.
*   **Remove the frozen lasagna from the freezer the day before you want to bake it**. This will help it bake more quickly in the oven.
*   **Freeze for 2-3 months.**

**How to Cook Frozen Lasagna**
------------------------------

This easy lasagna recipe will cook the most evenly and have the best results if you remove the lasagna from the freezer the day before you want to cook it. This will help it to mostly defrost and bake more easily.

*   Remove the wrappings, then cover with just one layer of foil.
*   Bake in a 350º F oven covered for about 50 minutes, then uncover and bake an additional 10 minutes.
*   \*\*If the lasagna was previously baked, you won’t need to bake it as long. Start at 30 minutes covered, then uncover and bake until heated through and bubbly on the edges.
