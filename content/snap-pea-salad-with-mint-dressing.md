snap pea salad with mint dressing

1/5/2020

easy to make, kids liked the sauce, but didn't like it smeared over the peas

**Ingredients**
---------------

*   Kosher salt
*   1 pound (450g) sugar snap peas, trimmed
*   1/4 cup (60ml) yogurt
*   2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil
*   1 tablespoon (15ml) mayonnaise
*   1/2 tablespoon (7ml) fresh juice from 1 lemon, plus small pinch freshly grated lemon zest
*   8 mint leaves, minced (about 1/2 tablespoon; 8ml)
*   1/2 ounce minced shallot (15g; about 1/2 small shallot)
*   Freshly ground black pepper
*   Bring a large saucepan of heavily salted water to a boil and prepare an ice bath. Add snap peas to boiling water and cook until crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or mesh strainer, transfer snap peas to ice bath to chill.
*   **2.  
    **Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, whisk together yogurt, olive oil, mayonnaise, lemon juice and zest, mint, and shallot. Season with salt and pepper.
*   **3.  
    **Drain snap peas thoroughly, then blot dry with clean kitchen towels or paper towels. Transfer to a serving bowl and toss with dressing until evenly coated. Check seasoning and add more salt if necessary, then serve right away.
