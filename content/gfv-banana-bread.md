### Instructions

Whisk together all dry ingredients and set aside. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F and line a medium loaf pan with parchment paper.

In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and mashed bananas, then vanilla and coconut oil until well combined.

Slowly stir the dry mixture into the wet (don’t use an electric mixer - you will overmix the batter and prevent it from rising properly) just until moistened and no visible flour remains.

Transfer batter to prepared loaf pan and bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes until deep golden brown and toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Allow to cool completely in the loaf pan resting on a wire rack, then remove using the parchment paper to help you, slice and serve. Enjoy!
