Of all the things I had anticipated about being a new mama — the sleep deprivation, the fact that sometimes babies cry _for no reason, whatsoever_, that they look [ridiculously cute things that are too big on them](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2642/4038917940_bca9d00a64.jpg) — at least one of the things that I hadn’t considered was, well, the Itch. The one you get at the end of your nose nearly the second after you start feeding the baby and have not a finger free to scratch it.

[![what you'll need](https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50514329631_c5d416930f_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&ssl=1)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/50514329631/in/photostream "what you'll need")

It’s not always an itch, though. Sometimes it’s a just a bit of water that you need — just a sip! from that glass just two feet in front of you! Oh, how you would do anything for that sip of water! But a lot of times these days, it’s a recipe. I can’t help it. I have so little time to cook and yet these recipe ideas are getting louder and louder in my head… winter salads and tangy pies and buttery leeks and funky salsas and I have more dishes than I could cook in two hundred nap times, it seems, nonetheless in the 15 minutes of a single one that is left after I have both scratched my nose _and_ taken that sweet, sweet sip of water.

So, I keep a list. I jot all of these ideas down and I arrange them according to urgency and to keep myself sane, I only look at the top item at any one time and try to plot my course accordingly. A couple weeks ago, it was a faintly gingerbread-spiced bread pudding with chunks of apples, studded with plumped raisins and on our next trip to the market, I bought some apples and on another trip, Alex bought some raisins and we hit up one of those Ukrainian restaurants in our neighborhood for some of their homemade challah and on another run I remembered to buy some milk and eggs and finally, 9 days and 14 hours and 26 minutes (or so) after I had started dreaming of a fall bread pudding that could be dessert or decadent breakfast or just something to make our apartment smell so ungodly awesome, [it even mesmerizes its tiniest inhabitant](http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/4092935362/), I had this one in front of me.

And — thank god — it was totally worth the wait.

### Raisin-Studded Apple Bread Pudding

Recipe notes: When I first made this in 2009, I did away with the separating eggs in the original recipe. I noted that you could add another egg and cup of milk if you’d like an eggier custard, but I rarely do this with a sweet, rich bread such as the challah shown here; it’s not needed. These days, in this 2020 update, I make several additional changes. I double the cinnamon (adjusted below from 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon), use a little less sugar (heaped 1/2 cup) when I’m using a sweet bread like challah and the full amount with a regular white bread, halve the raisins (using 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup), don’t plump them unless they’re hard, don’t bother heating the milk and molasses, and assemble everything in the baking dish, not a bowl. I do not remove the bread crusts (especially with challah), and I like to toast the almonds before I begin or they stay pale in the oven. Finally, I often make this the night before I need it and let it soak in the fridge overnight; I bake it cold from the fridge, to serve it warm.

*   1 pound bakery white or challah bread, crusts removed if you wish, cut into 1-inch cubes
*   1 Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored and cut into 1/2-inch pieces
*   1/2 to 1 cup golden raisins, plumped in hot water for 15 minutes, if necessary (see Note)
*   3 large eggs
*   Heaped 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup granulated sugar (see Note)
*   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
*   1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
*   1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
*   1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
*   1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
*   3 cups whole milk
*   2 tablespoons molasses
*   1/4 cup toasted, sliced almonds

Heat the oven to 350°F. Generously butter either a 9×13-inch deep baking dish or six 8-ounce ramekins. If using ramekins, set them on a baking sheet.

Spread the bread cubes on a large baking sheet and toast in the oven for 6 minutes, until crisp. Transfer to baking dish(es). Add the apples and raisin and toss gently to combine.

In a medium bowl, using a handheld electric mixer or whisk, beat the eggs with the sugar, spices, vanilla, salt, and molasses. Gradually add milk, beating well. Pour the custard over the bread mixture, nudging the bread around a bit to make sure it soaks all of the pieces. Let stand for 5 minutes at room temperature (minimum) or overnight in the fridge, covered tightly.

Sprinkle the almonds on top before baking. Bake in the center of the oven for about 40 minutes (and up to 50 minutes if cold from fridge), until puffed and set, with the tops lightly browned. Let the bread pudding(s) rest for at least 15 minutes before serving.
