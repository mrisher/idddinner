1.  In a shaker bag or sealable plastic bowl coat the shrimp with a ½ cup of cornstarch. Let the shrimp sit for about 5 minutes so that the cornstarch will adhere better.
2.  Heat 1 cup of vegetable oil in a wok (or large skillet) over medium heat. Add the shrimp to the wok and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes or until the shrimp are lightly browned and fully cooked. Remove from the wok with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Dump out the oil.
3.  Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in the wok over medium heat. Add garlic, ginger, and lemon slices and stir-fry for 15 seconds. Add soy sauce, and then dissolve 2 teaspoons of cornstarch in a ¾ cup of cold water, and add to the wok. Add brown sugar, lemon juice, and black pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
4.  Toss the fried shrimp with the sauce and top with green onions.
