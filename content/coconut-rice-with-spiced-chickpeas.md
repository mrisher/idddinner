**Creamy Coconut Rice and Spiced Chickpeas Ingredients:**

Gather your ingredients!

Below are notes about the ingredients before we get into the full recipe located lower in this post on how to make creamy coconut rice and chickpeas:

*   **Rice**– you can use brown or white rice. It is best to use pre-made rice that is at least one day old to really soak up the flavors.
*   **Chickpeas** – are the source of protein for the dish, as well high in vitamins and minerals that support heart health
*   **Garlic and Shallots** – the aromatics of the dish begin with fresh minced garlic and shallots
*   **Coconut Shreds** – add a crispy element to the dish while incorporating flavors to heighten the final flavor of the dish
*   **Ginger** – is used for anti-inflammatory benefit, but also delicious flavor throughout
*   **Kale** – is one of the most nutrient dense foods you can consume. Not only is kale added for that reason, but also for color and texture difference to the dish
*   **Canned Coconut Milk** – we are using canned coconut milk for it’s ability to make dishes creamy but yet still dairy free
*   **Sesame Seeds** – have a great source of protein, healthy fat, and minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants. Don’t let their small size full you! They also offer a great nutty flavor to the dish.
*   **Spices** – we are also adding, red pepper flakes, turmeric, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the dish to round out the flavors and give added health benefits.

Substitutions and Variations
----------------------------

*   **Rice**– you can use freshly made right but will be soggier than using day old rice. Alternatively, you could use another grain like quinoa.
*   ****Chickpeas** –** we’d recommend replacing chickpeas with a white bean like cannellini or great northern. Otherwise, you could replace with tofu, lentils, edamame, or even mushrooms. These later ingredients won’t crisp up like the chickpeas, so add those after cooking the garlic and shallots.
*   ****Shallots** –** replace with a yellow or white onion
*   ****Coconut Shreds** –** could be omitted if you don’t like a strong coconut flavor
*   ****Kale** –** replace with another leafy green like spinach
*   ****Canned Coconut Milk** –** if you can’t have or don’t like coconut, we’d recommend swapping with another creamy non-dairy milk like soy or the extra creamy oat milk.
*   ****Sesame Seeds** –** swap for chia seeds

**Frequently Asked Questions:**

**Can I make creamy coconut rice and chickpeas top 9 allergen free?**

Coconut and sesame are the two top 9 allergens in this dish. Swap your sesame seeds for chia seeds or omit. For the coconut shreds and milk, we’d recommend omitting the shreds and swapping the milk for an extra creamy oat milk. You will have to reduce longer if swapping the coconut milk.

**Can I prep this dish ahead of time?**

Yes, This dish can be prepared up to 3-4 days in advance. Make sure after making, let cool completely, then store in an air tight container.

**Why is it best to use day old rice?**
