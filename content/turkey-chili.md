Pretty much everyone in my family got an Instant Pot as a gift for the holidays. They were seriously discounted on Amazon just in time for the holidays. Since I don't want my family to starve I thought I would start writing up recipes for them and put them on here as well. There is already a killer chicken taco recipe on my site, but up next is turkey and sweet potato chili. 

If you are unfamiliar with the Instant Pot it is a counter top pressure cooker with a cult like following. My sister introduced me to it and I have totally started drinking the Instant Pot kool-aid. Since it is a pressure cooker, it cooks so many dishes in significantly less time compared to the stovetop or the oven. Plus the insert is dish washer safe so you can just through it in the dishwasher after you have eaten. I love it for stews and chilis but it also makes everything from hummus to yogurt to vegetables.

I have been making this recipe non-stop these past couple weeks. Feel free to substitute ground turkey for ground beef or pork. I love this recipe because it is healthy, full of flavor and most of all easy. Enjoy! 

Instant Pot Turkey and Sweet Potato Chili 
------------------------------------------

*   1 Tbs. olive oil
*   1/2 onion, diced
*   2 cloves garlic, minced
*   1 lb. ground turkey 
*   1 Tbs. chili powder
*   1/2 tsp. paprika 
*   1/2 tsp. ground cumin
*   1 tsp. salt, plus more to taste
*   1 1/2 lbs. sweet potato, diced into 1/2" dice
*   28 oz. can crushed tomatoes 
*   1 tsp. tomato paste
*   1/2 cup chicken broth
*   1 15. oz can black beans, drained and rinsed

Garnishes such as avocado, sour cream, cotija cheese, cilantro, green onions and jalapeños. 

Using the sauté function, add the olive oil and onion. Cook for about 1 to 2 minutes or until the onion begins to soften. Add the garlic and ground turkey. Brown the ground turkey for about 2 to 3 minutes, breaking up large chunks. Add the chili powder, paprika, cumin, salt, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, tomato paste and chicken broth. Stir well to combine. 

Add the lid to the Instant Pot and using the manual function set the timer to 12 minutes. 

Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then manually release the pressure. Fold in the black beans, taste for salt and serve warm with assorted garnishes. 

Serves 4 to 6
