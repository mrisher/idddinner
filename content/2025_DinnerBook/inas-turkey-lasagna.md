Hearty Tomato & Beef Lasagna  
1 tbsp Olive Oil 
1 Yellow Onion, Finely chopped 
6 Large Garlic Cloves, Minced 
1 lbs Ground Beef 
1/2 cup Heavy Cream 
28 oz Crushed Tomatoes (San 
Marzano) 
28 oz Diced Tomatoes (San Marzano), 
drained 
15 oz Ricotta Cheese 
1 1/2 cups Freshly Grated Parmesan 
Cheese, Divided 
1 cup Fresh Basil Leaves, Chopped 
1 egg 
12 No-Boil Lasagna Noodles 
1 lbs Shredded Mozzarella Cheese 
1.Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 
2.In a large skillet, sweat the onion in the olive oil over medium low heat 
until translucent and buttery soft, about 10 minutes.  Add in the garlic 
and cook until fragrant, about a minute more.   
3.Add the ground beef with about a tsp of salt and freshly ground pepper 
to the onion mixture and cook, stirring often and breaking up large 
chunks, until no longer pink.  Add in the cream and simmer until the 
liquid evaporates. 
4.Stir in the crushed and diced tomatoes and bring to a simmer.   
5.In a bowl, combine the ricotta, 1 cup of parmesan cheese, basil and egg.   
6.In a 9 x 13 glass dish, evenly spread one cup of the meat sauce along the 
bottom.  Top with three noodles then 1/3 of the cheese mixture.  Sprinkle 
1/2 cup mozzarella cheese on top.  Repeat this step two more times.  T 
7.Top with the final three noodles then spread the remaining meat sauce on 
top.  Sprinkle the rest mozzarella and 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese on top.   
8.Spray a piece of foil with nonstick spray and cover the casserole dish. If 
you plan to freeze the lasagna, stop at this step and allow the lasagna to 
cool 30 minutes before freezing.   
9.If enjoying right away, bake covered, for 30 minutes.  Remove the foil and 
bake about 20-25 minutes more until the top layer of cheese is golden 
brown, the sauce is bubbling hot and the internal temp is 165 at center.  
Let the lasagna cool for 15 minutes before slicing and serving. 
10.If frozen, thaw in the refrigerator for 24-36 hours before baking.  Bake 
covered in a 375 degree oven for 40-60 minutes depending on how long 
you thawed the lasagna.  Uncover and bake about 20 minutes more until 
the sauce is bubbling hot, cheese is golden brown and the temp at the 
center of the lasagna is at least 165 degrees when taken with a meat 
thermometer.
