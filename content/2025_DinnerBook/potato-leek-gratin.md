POULTRY 
Pulled BBQ Chicken Sandwiches with Slaw and Potato Salad 
Servings: 4 | Calories: About 700 Per Serving 
3 Boneless, Skinless Chicken Breasts 
4 Potato Buns 
½ Cup Barbecue Sauce 
3 Ounces Radishes 
2 Scallions 
1 lb Green Cabbage 
1 lb Fingerling Potatoes  
2 tbsp Red Wine Vinegar 
2 tbsp Sugar 
1 tbsp Dijon Mustard 
¼ Cup Mayonnaise 
3 tbsp Sweet Pickle Relish 
1.Preheat the toaster oven to 425°F. Boil a large pot of salted water. Once 
boiling, add the chicken. Cook 13-15 minutes, or until cooked through. 
Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean work surface. Using 2 forks, shred 
into bite-sized pieces. Wash and dry the pot. 
2.While the chicken cooks, boil a medium pot of salted water. Halve the 
buns. Thinly slice the scallions, separating the white bottoms and green 
tops. Cut out and discard the cabbage core; thinly slice the leaves. Halve 
and thinly slice the radishes. Cut the potatoes into ¼-inch-thick rounds. In 
a medium bowl, combine the mayonnaise and mustard. 
3.Add the potatoes to the medium pot of boiling water. Cook 12-14 
minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork. Turn off the heat. Drain 
thoroughly and return to the pot. Stir in the white bottoms of the 
scallions, sweet pickle relish and half the mayonnaise-mustard mixture; 
season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a serving dish. 
4.While potatoes cook, in a large bowl, combine the cabbage, radishes, 
vinegar, sugar, remaining mayonnaise-mustard mixture and all but a big 
pinch of the green tops of scallions; toss to combine and season with S&P. 
5.Toast buns in the oven 2-3 minutes, or until lightly crispy and warmed 
through. Remove from the oven. In the pot used to cook the chicken, 
combine the shredded chicken and barbecue sauce. Cook on medium-
low, stirring occasionally, 6 to 8 minutes, or until the chicken is thoroughly 
coated; season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from heat. 
6.Divide the finished chicken between the bun bottoms; top with some of 
the coleslaw (you will have extra coleslaw) and the bun tops. Serve with 
the potato salad and remaining coleslaw on the side; garnish with the 
remaining green tops of the scallions. Enjoy!
