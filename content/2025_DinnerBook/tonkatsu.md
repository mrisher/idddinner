#### For the tonkatsu sauce:

⅓ cup ketchup

¼ cup plus 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce

#### For the cabbage:

4 tbsps Kewpie mayonnaise 2 tbsps rice vinegar

1 tbsps soy sauce

#### For the tonkasu:

9 (usually 3 per package) boneless pork loin chops, trimmed of excess fat Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) Black pepper

1 tbsp vegetable oil, plus more for frying (about 7 cups)

2 tbsps granulated sugar 1 tbsp oyster sauce

1 tsp toasted sesame oil

3 cups shredded green cabbage

1 cup all-purpose flour 3 large eggs

1 box panko

Steamed rice, for serving

1.  Make the tonkatsu sauce and dressing: In a small bowl, combine the ketchup, Worcestershire, sugar and oyster sauce. In another small bowl, whisk the mayonnaise, rice vinegar, soy sauce and sesame oil. Taste and adjust seasonings, if needed.
2.  Prepare the tonkatsu: Using a sharp knife, make shallow slits on the pork loin, along the connective tissue, the white thick strip between the fat and the meat. Flip the pork and repeat on the other side. Using a meat mallet, lbs the pork until it’s ¼-inch thick. Lightly season the pork with salt and pepper, being mindful that the tonkatsu sauce is well seasoned.
3.  In a deep, heavy-bottomed pot, add 2 inches of oil. Heat over medium-high until the temperature reaches 350 degrees. Heat the oven to 200 degrees. Place a wire rack on a sheet pan for the fried pork. (If desired, line the sheet pan with parchment for easier cleanup.)
4.  Place the flour on a plate. In a shallow dish, like a pie plate, whisk the eggs and 1 tbsp of oil until combined. To a similar size dish, add the panko. Place a second sheet pan or a large plate nearby for the coated pork.
5.  Coat each piece of pork in the flour, shaking off any excess. Dip in the egg mixture, allowing any excess to drip back into the dish. Finally, coat in the

panko, gently pressing down to make sure it sticks to the pork. Place on the sheet pan and set aside for 10 minutes at room temperature to allow the crust to adhere to the meat.

1.  When the oil is at temperature, transfer the pork loins, one at a time to avoid overcrowding, to the hot oil. Fry for 1 minute, turn pork and fry the other side for 1 minute. Using tongs, remove the pork from the oil, holding it over the pot to allow any excess oil to drip off. Place on the wire rack and let it rest for 4 minutes. While the first pork loin rests, fry the second loin. After the 4 minute rest, return the first pork loin to the pot and fry for a second time, until golden brown, about 30 seconds per side. Lift the pork out, as before, and hold it on its side over the pot to allow any excess oil to drip off. (If you’d like, transfer to a separate wire rack on a sheet pan in a warm oven.) Repeat frying and resting with the remaining pork loins. In between each fry, use a mesh sieve or slotted spoon to skim off and discard any crumbs floating in the oil, and adjust the heat as necessary to maintain the temperature.
2.  Slice the pork into ¾-inch-thick strips and drizzle with the tonkatsu sauce. Serve alongside rice, and the shredded cabbage drizzled with the dressing, if you’d like.
