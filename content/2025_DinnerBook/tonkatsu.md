panko, gently pressing down to make sure it sticks to the pork. Place on the 
sheet pan and set aside for 10 minutes at room temperature to allow the 
crust to adhere to the meat. 
6.When the oil is at temperature, transfer the pork loins, one at a time to avoid 
overcrowding, to the hot oil. Fry for 1 minute, turn pork and fry the other side 
for 1 minute. Using tongs, remove the pork from the oil, holding it over the 
pot to allow any excess oil to drip off. Place on the wire rack and let it rest for 
4 minutes. While the first pork loin rests, fry the second loin. After the 4 
minute rest, return the first pork loin to the pot and fry for a second time, 
until golden brown, about 30 seconds per side. Lift the pork out, as before, 
and hold it on its side over the pot to allow any excess oil to drip off. (If you’d 
like, transfer to a separate wire rack on a sheet pan in a warm oven.) Repeat 
frying and resting with the remaining pork loins. In between each fry, use a 
mesh sieve or slotted spoon to skim off and discard any crumbs floating in 
the oil, and adjust the heat as necessary to maintain the temperature. 
7.Slice the pork into ¾-inch-thick strips and drizzle with the tonkatsu sauce. 
Serve alongside rice, and the shredded cabbage drizzled with the dressing, if 
you’d like.
