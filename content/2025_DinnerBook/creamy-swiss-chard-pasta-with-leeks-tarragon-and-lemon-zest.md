¾ lbs green Swiss chard (1 large bunch), washed and trimmed

2 large leeks (10 to 12 ounces each) 5 tbsp unsalted butter

½ cup panko bread crumbs Kosher salt and black pepper 3 tbsp nutritional yeast

3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced

2 tsp fresh thyme leaves

2 cups chicken or vegetable stock 1 cup heavy cream

16 oz linguine or fettuccine

¾ cup finely grated Parmesan Fresh tarragon leaves, for garnish 1 lemon, for garnish

1.  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Prepare the chard: Tear the leaves off the stems, separating the leaves and stems. Thinly slice the stems, then coarsely tear the leaves into bite-size pieces. Set both aside in separate bowls.
2.  Prepare the leeks: Trim off the bottom and the dark green portion at the top, halve the remaining white and pale green portion lengthwise, then thinly slice them crosswise. Wash and drain the sliced leeks. Set aside.
3.  Prepare the bread crumbs: In a large skillet, melt 2 tbsps butter over medium. Add the panko, season lightly with salt and generously with pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden and toasted, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in nutritional yeast, then transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
4.  Wipe out the skillet. Add the remaining 3 tbsps butter and melt over medium-high. Add the leeks, chard stems, garlic and thyme, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until leeks start to wilt and soften, about 5 minutes. Add the torn chard, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring, until just wilted, 2 minutes.
5.  Add the stock and heavy cream, and boil over high until thickened, about 10 minutes.
6.  Once the mixture is simmering, add the pasta to the pot of boiling water and cook until al dente. Drain pasta.
7.  Transfer chard mixture to the empty pasta pot. Stir in the cooked pasta, then sprinkle with the Parmesan, stirring vigorously to melt it into the sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
8.  Divide among shallow bowls or plates. Sprinkle generously with the prepared bread crumbs, top with tarragon and grate fresh lemon zest on top. Serve immediately.
