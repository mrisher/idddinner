One 28-oz can crushed tomatoes  
One 6-ounce can tomato paste 
1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf

1/2 cup chopped fresh basil leaves 
2 teaspoons kosher salt

cook for 1 more minute. Add the sausage and cook over medium-low 
heat, breaking it up with a fork, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until no longer 
pink. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 tablespoons of the parsley, the 
basil, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Simmer, 
uncovered, over medium-low heat, for 15 to 20 minutes, until thickened.  
3.Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with the hottest tap water. Add the noodles 
and allow them to sit in the water for 20 minutes. Drain.  
4.In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta, goat cheese, 1 cup of Parmesan, 
the egg, the remaining 2 tablespoons of parsley, remaining 1/2 teaspoon 
salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Set aside.  
5.Ladle 1/3 of the sauce into a 9 by 12 by 2-inch rectangular baking dish, 
spreading the sauce over the bottom of the dish. Then add the layers as 
follows: half the pasta, half the mozzarella, half the ricotta, and one 1/3 of 
the sauce. Add the rest of the pasta, mozzarella, ricotta, and finally, sauce. 
Sprinkle with 1/4 cup of Parmesan. Bake for 30 minutes, until the sauce is 
bubbling.
