Greek Chicken with Cucumber-Feta Salad 
Time: 30 minutes | New York Times 
1½ cups plain Greek yogurt 
3 garlic cloves, finely grated 
Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) 
Black pepper 
1 tsp dried oregano or mint 
2 lb boneless, skinless chicken 
thighs, patted dry 
1½ lb Persian cucumbers 
1 lb ripe tomatoes 
2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil 
4 oz feta, crumbled (about ¾ cup) 
½ cup Kalamata olives, pitted and 
halved 
1.In a large bowl, stir together the yogurt and garlic; season to taste with 
salt and pepper. Transfer ½ cup of the yogurt to a medium bowl and 
reserve for Step 5. 
2.Coat the chicken: To the large bowl, add the oregano and stir to 
combine. Season the chicken all over with 1½ tsps salt and a few grinds 
of pepper. Add the chicken to the large bowl and turn to coat; set aside. 
3.Start the salad: Smash the cucumbers with the side of your knife until 
craggy and split. Rip into ½- to 1-inch pieces and transfer to a colander 
placed in the sink. Slice or chop the tomatoes into bite-size pieces. Add 
to the cucumbers along with 1 ½ tsps salt. (It may seem like a lot of salt, 
but most will drain away.) Toss to combine and leave to drain. 
4.In a large nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet, heat the olive oil over 
medium. Scrape excess marinade off the chicken, then cook the chicken 
in batches, adding oil to the pan if necessary, until it’s well browned and 
releases from the pan, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip and cook until cooked 
through, another 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to plates to rest.  
a.To grill the chicken: Heat a grill to medium and clean and grease 
the grates. Grill the chicken over direct heat until it's well browned 
and releases from the grates, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip and cook until 
cooked through, another 5 to 7 minutes. (For a gas grill, close the 
lid between flips.) 
5.To the medium bowl of yogurt, add the feta and mash with a fork until a 
chunky paste forms. Shake the cucumbers and tomatoes to get rid of any 
excess moisture. Add to the feta yogurt along with the olives and stir until 
coated. The balance is dependent on your produce and feta, so season 
to taste with salt and pepper until flavors are vivid. Eat alongside the 
chicken.
