_Jon and Vinny’s_

1/4 cup olive oil

1 small shallot, finely minced 1 garlic clove, finely minced 1/2 cup tomato paste

2 tbsp vodka

1 cup heavy cream

1 tsp red pepper flakes, or to taste

Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper

1 lbs fusilli

2 tbsp butter

1 ounce freshly ground Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving

1/4 cup chopped fresh basil

1.  Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more, until fragrant. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until thick, brick-red and starting to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Add the vodka and cook, stirring constantly, until the liquid is mostly evaporated, about 2 minutes. Add the cream and red pepper flakes, stirring to fully combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
2.  While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat; once boiling, add the fusilli and cook, stirring occasionally, until just shy of al dente according to package directions. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water before draining the pasta.
3.  Transfer the drained pasta to the skillet with the sauce; add the butter and enough pasta water to thin the sauce slightly. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens and the pasta is al dente, about 2 minutes. Add more pasta water if needed to thin the sauce. Season with salt and pepper and add the 1 ounce of Parmesan cheese, tossing to coat. Serve with additional ground Parmesan and chopped fresh basil.
