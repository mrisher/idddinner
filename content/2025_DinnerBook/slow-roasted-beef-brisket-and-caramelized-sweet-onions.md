Serves 4-6

### Apple Cider-Ginger Barbecue Sauce

¾ cup brown sugar 1 cup ketchup

½ cup apple cider vinegar

1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce

### Caramelized Onions

¼ cup soy sauce

1 clove garlic, minced

1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated

2 tbsps extra virgin olive oil, plus more as needed

½ sweet yellow onion, cut into quarters, then thinly sliced crosswise 1 beef brisket, 1 to 3 lbs

1.  To prepare the barbecue sauce, place the brown sugar, ketchup, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger in a medium saucepan. Simmer over medium-low heat for 10 minutes. Refrigerate until ready to use.
2.  Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 300°F.
3.  To prepare the onions, spread the olive oil evenly in a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat, add the onions, and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden. Remove rom the pan and set aside.
4.  Turn up the heat to medium, add the brisket, and cook, turning once, until seared on both sides, about 5 minutes. You may need to add a bit more olive oil to keep the meat from sticking to the pan.
5.  Remove from the heat and spread the barbecue sauce evenly over the top of the meat. Sprinkle the cooked onions over the brisket, cover the skillet tightly with foil, and bake until fork-tender, about 3 hours. To serve, cut crosswise into ½-inch slices.
