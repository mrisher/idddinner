SIDES, SAUCES, AND APPETIZERS  
Corn and Bean Salad 
2 corn 
1 avocado 
1 can black beans 
1 lime 
1 tsp olive oil 
salt & pepper 
Optional: chopped bell peppers or 
shallot, cayenne pepper 
Grill the corn. Rinse and drain the beans. Chop the avocado. Mix in a bowl. Zest 
and squeeze the lime, add a splash of oil and season with salt & pepper. 
Squashed Cannellini Beans 
Rosemary 
Olive Oil 
Garlic 
Red Wine Vinegar 
1 can Cannellini Beans 
Pick the leaves off a couple of sprigs of rosemary and pound them gently in a 
mortar and pestle with a little salt. Add a glug of extra-virgin olive oil and stir, 
then put to one side. Fry two sliced cloves of garlic in a little olive oil until lightly 
golden. Add 1 ¾ cups of drained and rinsed cannellini beans and continue to 
simmer gently for seven minutes. Season the beans well with salt and pepper 
and a swig of red wine vinegar, then mash them up using the back of a fork until 
you have a coarse purée. Smear crostini with the bean purée and spoon your 
rosemary oil over the top.
