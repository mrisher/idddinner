2 tbsp olive oil

1 brown/yellow onion, diced

2 large garlic cloves, minced

1 (2 1/2”) piece of ginger, peeled and grated

1 tbsp curry powder

3/4 cup lentils, sorted and rinsed 1 (14.5 oz) can crushed tomatoes 1/2 cup chopped cilantro

1 (14 oz) can of coconut milk Lime wedges (to serve)

kosher salt and pepper, to taste

In a large dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-low heat. Add the onion with a pinch of salt and cook until soft and translucent, about 10 minutes.

Stir in the garlic, ginger and curry powder. Cook until fragrant, about a minute more, before stirring in the lentils to coat with the spices.

Stir in 2 1/2 cups water, the tomatoes, cilantro, coconut milk, a healthy pinch of salt and some freshly ground pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium heat.

Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are soft but not mushy. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed before serving with the lime wedges.
