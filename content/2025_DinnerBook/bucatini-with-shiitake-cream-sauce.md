45 min | serves 6

1 tbsp olive oil

1/4 lb fresh oyster mushrooms, roughly chopped (about 3/4 cup) 1/4 lb fresh shiitake mushrooms,

stems removed and roughly chopped (about 3/4 cup)

1/4 cup chopped fresh garlic (about 16 cloves)

1 medium shallot, roughly chopped 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper

1/4 cup (2 ounces) dry white wine 2 cups heavy cream

### Pasta

12 ounces bucatini 3 tbsp olive oil

1 lb mild or spicy Italian sausage, casings removed

1/4 lb fresh oyster mushrooms, sliced (about 2 cups)

1/4 lb fresh shiitake mushrooms, stems removed and sliced (about 2 cups)

1 medium shallot, finely chopped (about 1/4 cup)

4 large garlic cloves, minced (about 3 tbsp)

1/4 cup (2 ounces) dry white wine 1/2 cup chicken stock

1/2 tsp kosher salt 1/2 tsp black pepper

2 tsps grated lemon zest, plus 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice, divided

1.  Make the shiitake cream sauce: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Add oyster mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, garlic, shallot, and crushed red pepper; cook, stirring often, until fragrant and softened, about 4 minutes. Add wine; cook, stirring constantly, until liquid is almost completely reduced, 1 to 2 min. Stir in cream, and bring to a simmer over medium (do not boil). Reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring often, until mushrooms are tender and cream is slightly reduced, about 10 min.
2.  Transfer mushroom mixture to a blender. Secure lid, and remove center piece to allow steam to escape. Place a clean towel over opening; process until smooth, about 1 minute. Pour mixture through a fine wire- mesh strainer set over a medium heatproof bowl; discard solids. Cover and set aside.
3.  Make the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high. Add pasta, and cook according to package directions for al dente. Drain pasta, reserving 3/4 cup cooking liquid.
4.  Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Add sausage, and cook, stirring often to break into small crumbles, until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sausage to a medium bowl; reserve drippings in skillet.
5.  Heat skillet with drippings over medium-high. Add oyster and shiitake mushrooms; cook until golden brown on both sides, about 6 minutes, flipping halfway through. Stir in shallot and garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in reserved sausage. Add wine, scraping up browned bits from bottom of skillet. Stir in stock, salt, and pepper; bring to a simmer over medium-high. Reduce heat to medium, and cook until liquid is slightly reduced, 1 to 2 minutes.
6.  Stir shiitake cream sauce into sausage mixture in skillet; bring to a gentle simmer over medium. Add pasta, and toss until sauce coats noodles, adding reserved pasta water, 1/4 cup at a time, as needed to reach desired consistency. Stir in lemon juice. Divide pasta evenly among 4 bowls; top with lemon zest and additional black pepper. Serve immediately.
