4.Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Add sausage, and 
cook, stirring often to break into small crumbles, until browned, 4 to 5 
minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sausage to a medium bowl; 
reserve drippings in skillet.  
5.Heat skillet with drippings over medium-high. Add oyster and shiitake 
mushrooms; cook until golden brown on both sides, about 6 minutes, 
flipping halfway through. Stir in shallot and garlic; cook, stirring 
constantly, until fragrant and softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in reserved 
sausage. Add wine, scraping up browned bits from bottom of skillet. Stir 
in stock, salt, and pepper; bring to a simmer over medium-high. Reduce 
heat to medium, and cook until liquid is slightly reduced, 1 to 2 minutes.  
6.Stir shiitake cream sauce into sausage mixture in skillet; bring to a gentle 
simmer over medium. Add pasta, and toss until sauce coats noodles, 
adding reserved pasta water, 1/4 cup at a time, as needed to reach 
desired consistency. Stir in lemon juice. Divide pasta evenly among 4 
bowls; top with lemon zest and additional black pepper. Serve 
immediately.
