Pad Krapow Gai 
2-4 servings | NY Times | 15 min 
¼ cup vegetable oil 
1 lb ground chicken 
2 tsp minced garlic (from 2 cloves) 
2 tsp granulated sugar 
1 tsp minced fresh chile 
8 oz green beans, trimmed and cut 
into ½-inch pieces (about 1½ cups) 
3 tbsp oyster sauce 
2 tbsp fish sauce 
1 tbsp Thai light soy sauce 
Splash of rice vinegar 
1 cup loosely packed basil leaves 
Ground pepper, to taste 
Steamed jasmine rice, for serving 
 
Heat a wok or large nonstick skillet over medium-high, then swirl in the oil. Once 
the oil is shimmering, add the ground chicken and cook, actively breaking the 
chicken up into small pieces, until it is mostly cooked, about 6 minutes. 
 
Stir in the garlic, sugar and chile until evenly distributed and fragrant, about 2 
minutes, then add the green beans, oyster sauce, fish sauce and Thai seasoning, 
and cook, stirring constantly, until the chicken is fully cooked, the green beans 
are crisp-tender and the krapow is glossy, about 2 minutes. 
 
Remove from heat, add the basil and a dash of white pepper and toss to 
combine. If the sauce seems to cling too tightly to the mixture, add 1 to 2 tbsp 
of water to make it loose and glossy. 
 
Serve over rice, and top with a crispy fried egg, if desired. Serve with additional 
Thai seasoning to sprinkle on top, according to taste.
