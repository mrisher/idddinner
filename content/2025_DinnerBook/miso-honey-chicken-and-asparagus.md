3 tbsp white miso 3 tbsp mild honey

3 tbsp soy sauce or tamari

1 tbsp rice vinegar

2 tsp finely grated fresh ginger 2 tsp finely grated garlic

2 tsp chile-garlic sauce or other hot sauce

1 tbsp plus 2 tsps neutral oil 1½ to 2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs

2 large bunch asparagus, trimmed Salt and pepper

2 scallions, thinly sliced

Cooked rice (optional), for serving

Make the marinade: In a bowl, whisk together the miso, honey, soy sauce, rice vinegar, ginger, garlic, chile-garlic sauce, 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon water. Refrigerate half the marinade for serving.

Place the chicken in a shallow dish or zip-top bag and pour the remaining marinade over the top. Toss the chicken until coated and let marinate in the refrigerator for up to 30 minutes. (A longer marinade may dry out the chicken.)

When you are ready to cook, heat the broiler with a rack set 6 inches below it. Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil.

Remove the chicken from the marinade, scraping off and discarding any excess. Place the chicken in a single layer on one side of the baking sheet, with the flatter side up. Place the asparagus on the other side. Drizzle the asparagus with remaining oil, then season the asparagus; toss to coat.

Broil until the chicken is cooked through with some charred spots and the asparagus is browned, about 10 minutes.

To serve, top the chicken with a drizzle of the reserved marinade and a sprinkle of scallions. Serve with rice, if desired.
