Leek Fritters with Garlic and Lemon 
Servings: 10 fritters | Smitten Kitchen 
Fritters 
4 large leeks, pale green and white 
parts only 
2 scallions, trimmed, halved 
lengthwise and thinly sliced 
1/4 cup all-purpose flour 
1 tsp baking powder 
Freshly ground black pepper 
Pinch of cayenne 
1 egg 
Olive or vegetable oil, for frying 
Garlic Lemon Cream 
1/2 cup sour cream 
1 garlic clove, minced 
1 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice 
Pinch freshly grated lemon zest 
Salt 
1.Fill a bowl with cold water.  Cut the leeks in half lengthwise and plunge them 
in the water, fanning the layers to get rid of any grit.  Once they are clean, 
cut crosswise into 1/4-inch strips. 
2.Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the leeks for 3 to 4 minutes, 
until they are softened but not limp.   
3.While they are cooking, whisk together the flour, baking powder, a few grinds 
of black pepper, ginger, and cayenne. 
4.Drain the leeks and dry in a towel or cheesecloth.  Make sure to get rid of as 
much water as possible. 
5.Transfer the leeks to a large mixing bowl and add scallions.  Add the flour 
mixture to the leeks and toss to coat.  Add the egg and stir until it is 
incorporated with the mixture. 
6.Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place in the oven.  Heat the oven 
to 200 degrees. 
7.In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat until it begins to shimmer. 
 Scoop heaping tbsps of the batter into the skillet (I made 3 fritters at a time). 
 Using a spatula, gently flatten the fritter. Cook for approximately 3 minutes, 
or until it is golden brown.  If they are cooking too quickly, lower the heat. 
 Flip fritters and cook until the other side is golden.  Drain on paper towels 
and transfer to oven. 
8.Repeat with remaining batter. 
9.While they are in the oven, make the cream by whisking together all the 
ingredients and seasoning with a little salt. 
10.Serve fritters immediately and top with a dollop of cream and a little 
additional lemon zest.
