Orecchiette with Peas & Pancetta  
~30 min total 
1 tbsp olive oil 
1 (4-ounce) packages diced pancetta 
4-6 cloves garlic, minced  
1 cup frozen peas, thawed 
1 cup heavy cream 
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese 
1 lbs box orecchiette pasta 
1.Bring a large pot of water with a tbsp of salt to a boil over high heat. 
2.While the water comes to a boil, heat a large skillet over medium-low 
heat. Add the olive oil and diced pancetta. Cook, stirring every couple of 
minutes, until the fat renders and the pancetta gets crispy and golden 
brown, about 10 minutes. 
3.Once crispy, add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about a 
minute. 
4.Add the peas and cook until they turn bright green, about a minute more. 
(If you notice the garlic starting to turn more than light golden brown, 
don’t wait and add the cream now to avoid burning the garlic!) 
5.Your water should be boiling by now, so add the pasta, give it a good stir 
to ensure it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pot and cook according to 
the package directions. I like to use orecchiette as the peas and pancetta 
cling to these “little ears” beautifully. 
6.Next, if you haven't done so already, add the cream to your skillet and 
bring to a simmer. Once little bubbles start to form around the edges of 
the skillet, stir in the Parmesan cheese. Add some freshly ground pepper 
and adjust seasonings to taste. Remember, the pancetta and cheese are 
both salty, so you may or may not need to add more salt.   
7.Once your pasta is al dente, use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer the 
soaking wet pasta to the sauce. You want this extra pasta cooking liquid 
to help thin the sauce and continue cooking the pasta.   
8.Stir well to coat the pasta in the sauce. Taste and adjust seasonings to 
your liking. I usually add some more salt and freshly ground pepper. Let 
the pasta soak up the sauce a couple minutes before serving.
