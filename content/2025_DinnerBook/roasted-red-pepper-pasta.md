2 red bell peppers (~119 g each) 2-3 tbsp (30-45 ml) olive oil

2 shallots, finely chopped (~1/4 c or 40 g)

4 cloves garlic, finely chopped (2 tbsp or 12 g)

Sea salt and ground black pepper 1 1/2 cups (360 ml) cream

Pinch red pepper flake (optional, for heat)

12 oz (340 g) linguini or spaghetti

1.  Heat oven to 500 degrees F and roast red peppers on a baking sheet until charred - about 25-30 minutes. Cover in foil for 10 minutes to steam, and then remove (peel away) charred skin, seeds and stems. Set aside. While the red peppers are roasting, bring a large skillet over medium heat and sauté onion and garlic in 2-3 Tbsp olive oil until golden brown and soft - about 4-5 minutes. Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir. Remove from heat and set aside.
2.  Cook pasta according to package instructions; drain, toss in a touch of olive oil, cover with a towel and set aside.
3.  Transfer sautéed shallot and garlic to blender with roasted peppers, cream, and red pepper flake. Season with desired amount of salt, pepper and red pepper flake. Blend until creamy and smooth, taste and adjust seasonings as needed.
4.  Once blended, place sauce back in the skillet over medium heat to thicken. Once it reaches a simmer, reduce heat to low and continue simmering. Once sauce is thickened to desired consistency, add noodles. However, before tossing add a touch more olive oil, salt and pepper to the un-tossed noodles for added flavor. Then, toss to coat. Serve with (generous amounts of) Parmesan, red pepper flake and fresh chopped parsley or basil.
