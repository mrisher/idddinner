SOUPS 
Chicken Tortilla Soup 
3-4 chicken breasts 
6 cups chicken broth 
1 cup chopped green onions (greens and whites) 
1 small onion (chopped) 
2-3 jalapeños (chopped, I remove the seeds so it’s not too spicy) 
2 Roma tomatoes (seeded and diced) 
3 cloves of garlic (smashed) 
2 cobs of corn (or 1 cup frozen) 
3 tbps olive oil 
1 tsp cumin 
3 Tbsp (or more) fresh squeezed lime juice 
1/4 cup cilantro (roughly chopped) 
Salt and pepper to taste 
3 ripe avocados (diced) 
Queso Fresco, tortilla strips or chips, halved cherry tomatoes for garnish 
In a large soup pot, heat 1.5 tbsps olive oil over medium. Once hot, add green 
onions, chopped onion, and jalapeños. Cook until tender, approx. 3-4 minutes. 
Add garlic and saute for an additional 30 seconds or so, without burning. Next, 
add chicken broth, chicken breasts, tomatoes, cumin, salt, and pepper. Bring to 
a boil. Reduce heat to medium and cover for 15 minutes. Remove chicken 
breasts from pot and set aside for a few minutes. Add cilantro and lime juice to 
the broth mixture. In a cast iron skillet, heat the other 1.5 tbsps olive oil. Roast 
freshly cut corn kernels or frozen corn, stirring often until heavily browned. 
Meanwhile, shred chicken breasts with two forks and transfer chicken back into 
the pot. To serve, ladle soup into bowls. Top with a hefty serving of roasted 
corn, diced avocado (1/2 avocado per bowl), queso fresco crumbles, and a few 
halved cherry tomatoes. Garnish with lime wedges and tortilla strips or serve 
with chips, if desired.
