Tonkatsu 
1 hour | NY Times 
For the tonkatsu sauce: 
⅓ cup ketchup 
¼ cup plus 1 tbsp Worcestershire 
sauce 
2 tbsps granulated sugar 
1 tbsp oyster sauce 
For the cabbage: 
4 tbsps Kewpie mayonnaise 
2 tbsps rice vinegar 
1 tbsps soy sauce 
1 tsp toasted sesame oil 
3 cups shredded green cabbage 
For the tonkasu:
