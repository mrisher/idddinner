Rosemary Olive Oil Garlic

Red Wine Vinegar

1 can Cannellini Beans

Pick the leaves off a couple of sprigs of rosemary and pound them gently in a mortar and pestle with a little salt. Add a glug of extra-virgin olive oil and stir, then put to one side. Fry two sliced cloves of garlic in a little olive oil until lightly golden. Add 1 ¾ cups of drained and rinsed cannellini beans and continue to simmer gently for seven minutes. Season the beans well with salt and pepper and a swig of red wine vinegar, then mash them up using the back of a fork until you have a coarse purée. Smear crostini with the bean purée and spoon your rosemary oil over the top.
