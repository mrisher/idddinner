Skirt Steak With Salsa Verde Salad 
Makes: 4 Servings | 35 min, plus marinating | New York Times 
1½ lbs skirt steak 
½ c extra-virgin olive oil 
¼ c red-wine vinegar 
¼ c thinly sliced scallions (about 2) 
2 tbsp capers, drained & roughly 
chopped 
1 tbsp minced garlic (2 large cloves) 
½ tsp kosher salt, plus more to taste 
½ tsp black pepper 
2 tbsp chopped fresh flat-leaf 
parsley 
2 tbsp chopped fresh mint 
¼ cup toasted pine nuts 
2 romaine hearts 
½ c crumbled feta (about 3 oz) 
If necessary, cut the steak crosswise into large pieces that will fit into a shallow, 
nonreactive dish. Transfer the steaks to the dish. In a glass measuring cup or 
bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, scallions, capers, garlic, ½ tsp salt 
and ½ tsp pepper. Pour about ⅓ of the dressing (about ⅓ cup) over the steak 
and turn to coat both sides. 
 
Add the parsley and 1 tbsp mint to the reserved dressing, stir, and set aside until 
ready to use. Cover and refrigerate the steak for at least 30 minutes or up to 24 
hours. (If marinating the steak overnight, cover and refrigerate the reserved 
dressing.) 
 
In a small sauté pan set over medium heat, toast the pine nuts, tossing often, 
until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Set aside. 
 
Set the grill to medium-high heat, or heat a grill pan on the stovetop over 
medium-high. Pat the steaks dry with a paper towel and grill for 3 to 5 minutes 
on each side for medium-rare. Transfer to a plate, sprinkle with salt, and allow to 
rest for 10 minutes. 
 
While the steak rests, cut the romaine hearts lengthwise into quarters. Arrange 
the romaine hearts in one layer on a large platter, leaving room on one side for 
the steak. Sprinkle the feta, pine nuts and the remaining 1 tbsp mint over the 
romaine. Slice the steak crosswise into 3-inch pieces, then slice against the grain 
to cut the steak into wide strips. Arrange the sliced steak on the platter, then 
drizzle the reserved dressing over the romaine and steak. Serve immediately.
