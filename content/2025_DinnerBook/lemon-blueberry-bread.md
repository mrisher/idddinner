Mike’s Monkey Bread 
makes a bundt pan or a 9" X 9" casserole dish 
4 tins Pillsbury biscuits  or 2 tins of 
Pillsbury Grands  
½ cup white sugar 
½ tsp ground cinnamon 
1½ sticks of butter 
1 cup brown sugar 
1 tbsp ground cinnamon 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease up a bundt pan or a 9" X 9" casserole 
dish.  Pam will do, but butter is better. Just pop open tins and cut biscuits them 
into quarters.  Put those quarter pieces into a bag or bowl with white sugar and 
1 tsp of cinnamon, shake it all about, and transfer to your dish.   
Put ¾-cup butter (about 1½ sticks), brown sugar, and 1 tbs of cinnamon into a 
sauce pan and melt them down into a smooth, uniform caramel sauce.  Pour 
your sauce over the biscuits; it will be a lot of sauce.  Bake for about 30 minutes 
(or until it stops expanding and the caramel sets on the outside).  Wait at least 
10 minutes, then dump out of your dish onto a plate and serve!  If you don't 
wait, you'll have monkey mess on your hands.
