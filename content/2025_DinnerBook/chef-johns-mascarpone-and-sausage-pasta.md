1/4 lb fresh oyster mushrooms, 
roughly chopped (about 3/4 cup) 
1/4 lb fresh shiitake mushrooms, 
stems removed and roughly chopped 
(about 3/4 cup) 
1/4 cup chopped fresh garlic (about

1 medium shallot, roughly chopped 
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper 
1/4 cup (2 ounces) dry white wine 
2 cups heavy cream 
Pasta 
12 ounces bucatini 
3 tbsp olive oil 
1 lb mild or spicy Italian sausage, 
casings removed 
1/4 lb fresh oyster mushrooms, sliced 
(about 2 cups) 
1/4 lb fresh shiitake mushrooms, 
stems removed and sliced (about 2 
cups) 
1 medium shallot, finely chopped 
(about 1/4 cup) 
4 large garlic cloves, minced (about 3 
tbsp) 
1/4 cup (2 ounces) dry white wine 
1/2 cup chicken stock 
1/2 tsp kosher salt 
1/2 tsp black pepper 
2 tsps grated lemon zest, plus 2 tbsp 
fresh lemon juice, divided 
  
1.Make the shiitake cream sauce: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. 
Add oyster mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, garlic, shallot, and crushed 
red pepper; cook, stirring often, until fragrant and softened, about 4 
minutes. Add wine; cook, stirring constantly, until liquid is almost 
completely reduced, 1 to 2 min. Stir in cream, and bring to a simmer over 
medium (do not boil). Reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring often, until 
mushrooms are tender and cream is slightly reduced, about 10 min.  
2.Transfer mushroom mixture to a blender. Secure lid, and remove center 
piece to allow steam to escape. Place a clean towel over opening; 
process until smooth, about 1 minute. Pour mixture through a fine wire-
mesh strainer set over a medium heatproof bowl; discard solids. Cover 
and set aside.  
3.Make the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high. Add 
pasta, and cook according to package directions for al dente. Drain pasta, 
reserving 3/4 cup cooking liquid.
