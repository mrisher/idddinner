Ginger-Lime Chicken 
Time: 15 minutes | New York Times 
1½ to 2 lb boneless, skinless chicken 
thighs or breasts 
Kosher salt (such as Diamond 
Crystal) and black pepper 
⅓ cup mayonnaise 
1 tbsp lime zest (2 limes), plus lime 
wedges, for serving 
1 tbsp finely grated fresh ginger (~3-
inch piece of peeled ginger) 
Pat the chicken dry and season all over with 1½ tsps salt. In a medium bowl, stir 
together the mayonnaise, lime zest and ginger; season with salt and pepper. 
Add the chicken to the mayonnaise mixture and stir to coat. (The chicken can sit 
in the marinade for up to 8 hours in the fridge. Let come to room temperature 
before cooking.) 
To grill: Heat a grill to medium-high. Grill the chicken over direct heat until 
cooked through and juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side for thighs and 
about 4 minutes per side for breasts, turning as necessary to avoid burning. 
To cook in a skillet: Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Cook the chicken until 
juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side for thighs and about 4 minutes per 
side for breasts. 
Serve chicken with lime wedges, for squeezing on top.
