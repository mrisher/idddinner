Salsa Verde Chicken Tacos 
Time: 25 minutes | Real Simple 
1 1/4 lb boneless skinless chicken 
thighs 
1/4  tsp kosher salt 
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper 
2 tbsp olive oil 
16 oz salsa verde 
12 corn tortillas 
1 avocado, sliced  
1/2 cup finely chopped red onion 
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped 
2 oz cotija cheese, crumbled 
Lime wedges, for serving 
Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over 
medium until shimmering. Add chicken; cook until golden brown, about 3 
minutes per side. Add salsa verde. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook, partially 
covered, stirring occasionally and flipping chicken halfway through, until a 
thermometer inserted in thickest part of a chicken thigh reads 165°F, 6 to 8 
minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes.  
Transfer chicken to a large bowl and shred with 2 forks. Return chicken to pot 
and toss with salsa verde until well coated.  
Warm tortillas in microwave, over a gas flame on stove, or in a dry skillet. Top 
tortillas with chicken, avocado, onion, cilantro, and cheese. Serve with lime 
wedges, if desired.
