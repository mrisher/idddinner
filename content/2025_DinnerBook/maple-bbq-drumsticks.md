8 chicken drumsticks (about 2 lbs total), patted

dry

Salt and pepper

Maple Barbecue Sauce (recipe follows)

1.  Preheat the oven to 425°F, with one rack in the middle and another so that the chicken will be 3 to 4 inches from the broiler. Put the chicken on a sheet pan (lined with foil for easier cleanup, if you like). Season with salt and pepper and arrange top-side up and in alternating directions. Roast on the middle rack until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
2.  Brush some of the Maple Barbecue Sauce on the drumsticks, then flip them over and brush the other side. Roast until cooked through, about 10 minutes more. Remove from the oven and preheat the broiler. Flip the drumsticks over again, brush with more sauce, and broil on the upper rack until the sauce caramelizes, keeping a close eye on them to prevent burning, about 1 minute. Serve hot or at room temperature.

1 tbsp olive oil

1 small yellow onion, finely chopped

1 garlic clove, minced 1 tsp salt

Pinch of cayenne pepper

½ tsp turmeric

⅔ cup ketchup

2 tbsp maple syrup

½ cup apple cider vinegar 2 tbsp whole-grain mustard

1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce

Grated zest and juice of 1 lime Pepper

1.  In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the onion, garlic, and salt and cook until the onion is softened, about 8 minutes. Add the cayenne and turmeric and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the ketchup, maple syrup, vinegar, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and lime zest and stir to combine
2.  Bring the sauce to a simmer, then season with lime juice, salt, and pepper. If the sauce needs more acid, add more vinegar or lime juice; if it needs more sweetness, add more maple syrup. If you're not using the sauce right away, let cool and transfer to a covered container. The Maple Barbecue Sauce will keep, covered in the refrigerator, for about 4 days. If serving as a dipping sauce, warm before using.
