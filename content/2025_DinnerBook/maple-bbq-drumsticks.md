Chicken Shawarma  
Pamela Saltzman 
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil 
¼ cup lemon juice (~2 lemons) 
2 tsp kosher salt 
2 tsp ground cumin 
2 tsp paprika 
½ tsp ground turmeric 
⅛ tsp ground cinnamon, or 
more to taste 
⅛ tsp cayenne pepper, or 
more if you want it to be spicy 
Several grinds of black pepper 
4 garlic cloves, minced 
2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken 
thighs, trimmed of excess fat 
White sauce (recipe follows) 
Lavash/Pita 
Romaine hearts 
1.Prepare the marinade: Combine all the marinade ingredients in a 
nonreactive bowl (e.g., glass). Add the chicken and toss to coat. Marinate 
at room temperature for 1 hour or in the refrigerator for several hours or 
up to overnight. 
2.Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking. 
Preheat the oven to 400F or a heat a grill to medium heat. If you are 
baking, line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 
3.Grill until cooked through, about 7 minutes on each side, or bake on the 
prepared baking sheet for 35 minutes, or until cooked through. If the 
chicken was baked, you may slice it thinly and sauté the slices in a skillet 
in coconut oil or olive oil, to get some crispy edges. You don't have to do 
this step since the chicken is already cooked, but the crispy edges 
somewhat mimic traditional shawarma shaved off the spit. I also like to 
sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt, too. 
4.Slice thinly and serve with your desired accompaniments like lavash, 
lettuce, tomato, pickled vegetables, onion, olives 
⅔ cup plain whole Greek yogurt 
½ cup good-quality mayonnaise  
3 garlic cloves, minced 
1 tbsp freshly squeezed 
lemon juice 
⅛ tsp sea salt 
⅛ tsp paprika 
Freshly ground black pepper 
5.Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl, adding black pepper to taste. 
Refrigerate until ready to serve. Can be made 1 day in advance. Stir 
before serving.
