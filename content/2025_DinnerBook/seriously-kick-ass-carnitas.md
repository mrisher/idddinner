One 4 to 5 lb bone-in pork shoulder (Boston butt) —works fine w/o bone Kosher salt

3 cups chicken broth or water

1 white/yellow onion, quartered 1 tbsp dried oregano

1 tbsp cumin seed 1 tsp paprika

1 hr before starting to cook, remove the meat from the fridge, rinse, and pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

Place pork in 5—7 qt Dutch oven. Add broth, onion, oregano, cumin, and paprika. Add a generous pinch of salt. Place over high heat, cover, and bring to a boil; spoon some hot liquid over the top of the meat, then cover again and transfer to the oven.

Cook until meat is literally falling apart, about 4 hours, spooning liquid over meat once or twice during cooking.

Remove pot from oven and place on stove top. Transfer meat to platter (we don't do this part). With large spoon, push meat off the bone in chunks, discard the bone and any large pieces of fat. Put meat back in pot and turn on heat to medium-high, cook, stirring to break it up with a spoon, until liquid in pot has almost entirely evaporated and meat begins to sizzle, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve.
