FISH  
Grilled Lemon-Herb Shrimp 
Serves 6-8 
¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice 
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil 
4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced 
¼ cup chopped mixed fresh herbs 
(mint, parsley, and thyme is a 
good combo) 
1 tsp sea salt 
Freshly ground black pepper 
1½ lbs large wild-caught, peeled and 
deveined shrimp, rinsed and patted 
dry 
1.Mix together all the ingredients, except the shrimp, in a shallow, 
nonreactive container (e.g., glass), adding pepper to taste. Add the 
shrimp and toss to coat well. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. 
2.Have ready eight skewers. If using wooden or bamboo skewers, soak 
them in water while the shrimp marinate. 
3.Thread four or five shrimp on each skewer. 
4.Preheat the grill to medium heat. Grill the shrimp about 3 minutes on 
each side, or until cooked through. 
Roast Salmon Glazed with Brown Sugar and Mustard 
Salmon fillets, preferably wild or 
farmed organically 
Dijon mustard 
Brown sugar 
Salt and black pepper 
1.Heat your oven to 400 degrees. 
2.Make a mixture of Dijon mustard and brown sugar to the degree of 
spicy-sweetness that pleases you. Salt and pepper the salmon fillets. 
3.Place the salmon fillets skin-side down on a lightly oiled, foil-lined 
baking sheet. Slather the tops of the fillets with the mustard and 
brown sugar glaze and slide them into the top half of your oven. Roast 
for about 12 minutes, then serve.
