_Time: 25 minutes | Real Simple_

1 1/4 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs

1/4 tsp kosher salt

1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper 2 tbsp olive oil

16 oz salsa verde

12 corn tortillas

1 avocado, sliced

1/2 cup finely chopped red onion 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped

2 oz cotija cheese, crumbled Lime wedges, for serving

Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium until shimmering. Add chicken; cook until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Add salsa verde. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook, partially covered, stirring occasionally and flipping chicken halfway through, until a thermometer inserted in thickest part of a chicken thigh reads 165°F, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes.

Transfer chicken to a large bowl and shred with 2 forks. Return chicken to pot and toss with salsa verde until well coated.

Warm tortillas in microwave, over a gas flame on stove, or in a dry skillet. Top tortillas with chicken, avocado, onion, cilantro, and cheese. Serve with lime wedges, if desired.
