4 tbsp toasted sesame oil (3 for glaze and 1 for broccoli)

2 tbsp soy sauce or tamari 1 tbsp rice vinegar

1 tbsp honey

1 (2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated (about 1 tbsp)

1 garlic clove, finely grated 1 lb broccoli florets

2 scallions, trimmed and cut diagonally into 1½-inch segments, plus thinly sliced scallions for garnish 1 tbsp olive oil

Kosher salt and black pepper

4 (6-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets

½ lime, for serving Sesame seeds, for serving

1.  Heat the oven to 425 degrees. In a small bowl, whisk 3 tbsps sesame oil with the soy sauce, vinegar, honey, ginger and garlic until smooth. Set the glaze aside.
2.  Place the broccoli florets and 1½-inch scallion segments on a sheet pan. Drizzle with 1 tbsp olive oil and the remaining 1 tbsp sesame oil. Sprinkle with ½ tsp salt and ¼ tsp black pepper, toss well and roast for 5 minutes.
3.  While the broccoli and scallions roast, place the salmon fillets on a plate and pat dry with paper towels. Brush all over with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
4.  Toss the broccoli and scallions and move to the edges of the pan, clearing spaces in the center for the salmon fillets. Place the salmon fillets, evenly spaced, on the center of the pan. Brush the fillets generously with the glaze.
5.  Return the pan to the oven and roast until the salmon is cooked through but still slightly rare in the center, about 12 minutes.
6.  Squeeze the lime over the broccoli and sprinkle with salt. Scatter the sliced scallions and sesame seeds over the salmon, and serve hot.
