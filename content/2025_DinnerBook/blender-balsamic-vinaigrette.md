_Food52_

1 medium shallot, chopped 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar

2 tbsp honey, maple syrup, or granulated sugar

2 tsp Dijon mustard

1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt 2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil

Add the shallot, vinegar, honey, mustard, and salt to a blender. Blend until smooth, scraping down as needed. While blending, slowly drizzle in the olive oil to emulsify. Taste and adjust if you'd like (say, more mustard for more spice).

Sealed in a jar, this keeps well in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
