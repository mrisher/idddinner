Potato Leek Gratin 
Servings: 6 | NY Times | 1 hour 30 min 
2 tbsp unsalted butter, more for 
greasing the pan 
2 large leeks, trimmed and halved 
lengthwise 
1½ lbs peeled Yukon Gold potatoes 
1 tsp kosher salt 
½ tsp ground black pepper 
2 thyme sprigs 
1 cup heavy cream 
1 fat garlic clove, finely chopped 
1 bay leaf 
¼ tsp freshly ground nutmeg 
¾ cup Gruyère, grated 
1.Heat oven to 350 degrees and butter a 2-quart gratin dish. Wash the leeks to 
remove any grit and slice thinly crosswise. 
2.Using a mandolin or sharp knife, slice the potatoes into rounds, ⅛-inch thick. 
Toss with ¾ tsp salt and ¼ tsp pepper. Layer the rounds in the gratin dish. 
3.Melt the 2 tbsp butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add leeks, 
remaining salt and pepper, and thyme. Cook, stirring, until leeks are tender 
and golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Discard thyme and scatter the leeks over the 
potatoes. 
4.Add cream, garlic and bay leaf to the skillet, scraping up browned bits of 
leeks from the bottom of the pan. Simmer gently for 5 minutes. Stir in 
nutmeg. 
5.Pour the cream over the leeks and potatoes and top with the Gruyère. Cover 
with aluminum foil and transfer to the oven. Bake for 40 minutes, uncover 
and bake until the cheese is bubbling and golden, 15 to 20 minutes longer. 
Let cool slightly before serving.
