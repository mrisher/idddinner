_Makes: 4 Servings | 30 min | New York Times_

Kosher salt and black pepper 2 tbsp olive oil

1medium yellow onion, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped

½ lb ground beef (preferably 20 percent fat), pork or dark meat turkey 12 oz spaghetti, pappardelle or other long pasta

¼ cup tomato paste

2 tsp Worcestershire sauce Grated Parmesan, for serving

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add onion, garlic and ½ tsp salt and cook, stirring often, until beginning to soften, 3 minutes. Add beef and cook, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, about 3 minutes.

Add pasta to the pot and cook according to package instructions until al dente.

Meanwhile, add tomato paste to skillet and cook, stirring, until darkened, about 1 minute. Add 1 cup water, Worcestershire, ½ tsp pepper and ½ tsp salt and simmer until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes.

Using tongs, transfer pasta directly from the pot to the skillet along with 1 cup pasta water. Increase heat to high and simmer vigorously, tossing, until sauce reduces and coats the pasta, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with Parmesan.
