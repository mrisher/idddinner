VEGETARIAN 
Emmentaler on Rye with Sweet and Sour Red Onion 
Servings: 2 sandwiches | Smitten Kitchen 
Onions 
1 tbsp olive oil 
1 tbsp unsalted butter 
1 large red onion, halved and thinly 
sliced (about 2 cups) 
2 tsp brown sugar 
¼ tsp salt, plus more to taste 
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar 
Freshly ground black pepper 
Sandwiches (Serves 2) 
Four ½ inch-thick slices rye bread 
2 tbsps butter, salted or unsalted, 
softened 
¾ cup (about 3 oz) Emmentaler or 
another Swiss cheese (e.g., Gruyere), 
grated 
1.Cook onions: Heat the olive oil and 1 tbsp butter in a large skillet over 
medium-high heat. Add the onion, and sauté for 5 minutes. Add the 
brown sugar and salt, lower the heat to medium-low, and cook another 
10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the vinegar, and scrape and stuck 
onion bits from the bottom of pan with a spoon. Simmer for 1 to 2 
minutes, until the onion mixture thickens, and season to taste with black 
pepper. Cool to lukewarm, or store in an airtight container in the 
refrigerated until needed, up to 5 days. 
2.Make sandwiches: Generously butter 1 side of each slice of bread. 
Arrange one slice, buttered side down, on a plate. Spread thickly with 
jammy onions (about 2 tbsps per sandwich; you’ll have extra). Sprinkle 
with half the grated cheese. Arrange a second slice of bread on top of the 
cheese, buttered side facing up. Repeat with the remaining slices.  Heat a 
heavy 12-inch skillet to medium-low. Once it’s hot, place the sandwiches 
on the griddle, and cook them until crisp and deep golden brown, about 
5 minutes per side. Slice the sandwiches in half and serve immediately.
