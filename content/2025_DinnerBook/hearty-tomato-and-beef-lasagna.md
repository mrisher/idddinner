1 tbsp Olive Oil

1 Yellow Onion, Finely chopped 6 Large Garlic Cloves, Minced

1 lbs Ground Beef 1/2 cup Heavy Cream

28 oz Crushed Tomatoes (San Marzano)

28 oz Diced Tomatoes (San Marzano), drained

1.  Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.

15 oz Ricotta Cheese

1 1/2 cups Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese, Divided

1 cup Fresh Basil Leaves, Chopped 1 egg

12 No-Boil Lasagna Noodles

1 lbs Shredded Mozzarella Cheese

1.  In a large skillet, sweat the onion in the olive oil over medium low heat until translucent and buttery soft, about 10 minutes. Add in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about a minute more.
2.  Add the ground beef with about a tsp of salt and freshly ground pepper to the onion mixture and cook, stirring often and breaking up large chunks, until no longer pink. Add in the cream and simmer until the liquid evaporates.
3.  Stir in the crushed and diced tomatoes and bring to a simmer.
4.  In a bowl, combine the ricotta, 1 cup of parmesan cheese, basil and egg.
5.  In a 9 x 13 glass dish, evenly spread one cup of the meat sauce along the bottom. Top with three noodles then 1/3 of the cheese mixture. Sprinkle 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese on top. Repeat this step two more times. T
6.  Top with the final three noodles then spread the remaining meat sauce on top. Sprinkle the rest mozzarella and 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese on top.
7.  Spray a piece of foil with nonstick spray and cover the casserole dish. If you plan to freeze the lasagna, stop at this step and allow the lasagna to cool 30 minutes before freezing.
8.  If enjoying right away, bake covered, for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake about 20-25 minutes more until the top layer of cheese is golden brown, the sauce is bubbling hot and the internal temp is 165 at center. Let the lasagna cool for 15 minutes before slicing and serving.
9.  If frozen, thaw in the refrigerator for 24-36 hours before baking. Bake covered in a 375 degree oven for 40-60 minutes depending on how long you thawed the lasagna. Uncover and bake about 20 minutes more until the sauce is bubbling hot, cheese is golden brown and the temp at the center of the lasagna is at least 165 degrees when taken with a meat thermometer.
