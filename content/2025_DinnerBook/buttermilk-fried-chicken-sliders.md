Mustard Milanese with an Arugula Fennel Salad 
Time: 75 min | Smitten Kitchen 
For the chicken: 
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts 
salt and pepper 
1/2 cup all purpose flour 
1 large egg white 
2 tbsp Dijon mustard (smooth) 
2 garlic cloves (minced) 
1 tsp dried oregano 
1/2 tsp grated lemon zest (fresh) 
1 1/2 cups panko 
Mix of vegetable/olive oil, for frying 
For the salad: 
3 tbsp lemon juice (freshly 
squeezed, from 1 large lemon) 
2 Tbsp. seed (whole-, or coarse 
Dijon mustard) 
1 tbsp Dijon mustard (smooth) 
1/4 cup olive oil 
5 oz baby arugula 
Small fennel bulb 
1.Butterfly your chicken breasts, so that you end up with four thin cutlets. Lbs 
your cutlets out between two pieces of plastic wrap to 1⁄4-inch thickness. 
Season the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. 
2.Grab three big plates, and line them up on your counter. Pour the flour into 
the first one. In a small dish, whisk together the egg white, smooth Dijon, 
garlic, oregano, and lemon zest. Pour half of this mixture into the bottom of 
the second plate. In the third plate, spread out the breadcrumbs. Dredge 
each piece of chicken lightly in flour, then heavily in the egg-white– mustard 
mixture, and generously in the breadcrumbs. 
3.Repeat with second piece of chicken, then refill egg-white–mustard plate, 
and repeat with final two pieces of chicken. Arrange cutlets on a tray, and 
chill them in the fridge for 1 hour, or up to 1 day (covered with plastic wrap). 
4.Preheat your oven to 175. Pour 1⁄2 inch of oil in a large pan and heat over 
medium-high heat. Test with a flick of water—if it hisses, you’re good to go. 
Cook the chicken until golden brown (about 3-4 minutes on first and 2-3 
minutes on second). Remove the chicken from heat, and salt and pepper on 
both sides while draining on paper towels. Once it’s drained, transfer to a 
tray to keep in the warm oven. Repeat with more oil and remaining chicken. 
5.In a small bowl, whisk lemon juice and mustards together, then whisk in olive 
oil in a thin stream. Pour three-quarters of this into a large bowl. Add arugula 
to bowl. Thinly shave your fennel bulb on a mandoline, or cut it as thinly as 
you can with a sharp knife, and add this to the arugula. 
6.When you’re ready to serve it, toss the salad. Arrange one piece of chicken 
from the warm oven on a plate. Drizzle a few drops of the reserved salad 
dressing directly onto the chicken, and pile the salad on top. Season with salt 
and pepper, and eat immediately.
