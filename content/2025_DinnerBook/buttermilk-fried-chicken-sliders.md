Time: 20 min marinade and 20 min cook

6 Potato Slider Buns 2 lbs Chicken Breasts

¼ cup Buttermilk

½ cup Panko Breadcrumbs

1.  Preheat the toaster oven to 350°F. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Slice each slider bun in half lengthwise. Cut each chicken breast into thirds.
2.  Place the chicken pieces in a small bowl with the buttermilk. Set aside to marinate.
3.  Place the panko breadcrumbs in a small bowl; then, working one piece of chicken at a time, remove the marinated chicken from the buttermilk (letting any excess buttermilk drip off) and completely cover in the breadcrumbs. Place the breaded chicken on a plate.
4.  In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat a 1/4-inch layer of oil on medium-high until hot. When the oil is hot enough that a few breadcrumbs sizzle immediately when added to the pan, add the breaded chicken. Cook 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan, letting any excess oil drip off. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; season with salt and pepper immediately.
5.  Place the slider buns on a sheet pan and toast in the oven for 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly golden and warmed through. To plate your dish, divide the fried chicken between the slider buns. Top with as much Tabasco as you’d like. Serve with the coleslaw on the side. Enjoy!
