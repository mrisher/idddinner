PIZZA and PASTA  
Easy Homemade Pizza Dough 
Bless this Mess Blog 
2 1/2 cups warm water 
1 tbsp yeast 
1 tbsp sugar 
1 tsp salt 
1/4 cup olive oil 
6 to 6 1/2 cups flour 
1.In a large mixing bowl, add the water, yeast, sugar, salt, and olive oil. 
Allow mixture to stand for 5 minutes. 
2.Add one cup of flour, and mix to combine. Add another cup of flour 
and mix through. Mix by hand for 1 or 2 minutes. The dough should 
be the consistency of cake batter. Add another cup of flour and mix 
until well combined. Add flour until you can’t mix it by hand very well. 
3.Sprinkle some flour on your table and turn the dough onto the table. 
Knead the dough by hand until it is smooth and elastic, adding flour 
as needed. This should take 6 to 10 minutes of kneading. You can also 
do this part in a stand mixer if you have one. 
4.Place the dough back in the bowl, cover it with a towel, and let it rise 
in a warm place for 15 to 60 minutes (This time varies a lot for me – I 
just let it rise according to how long it is until dinner time).
