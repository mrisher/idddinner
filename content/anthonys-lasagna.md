Anthony says make 2x and freeze

9/6/2021

No basil

Store bought marinara (the good stuff)

Log of whole foods mozzarella, didn’t shred

50 oz tomato sauce not enough -- need another cup

5 noodles per layer (one whole box of WF lasagna noodles enough)

Can use store bought sauce and add to browned meat, instead of making your own. Use 1lb lean beef, 1lb mild sausage cut into chunks.

Need about 50oz of tomato sauce

Worked better with 4 layers of 4 noodles in 16 x 9 pan

Didn’t use basil and regretted it -- lacked umami.

**Tomato Meat Sauce**: In Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat; cook onions, celery, carrot and garlic, stirring occasionally,until softened, about 5 minutes.Stir in tomato paste. Add beef; cook,breaking up with spoon, until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes,wine, bay leaves, oregano, salt and pepper; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 40 minutes. Discard bay leaves.

**Make-ahead**: Let cool for 30 minutes. Refrigerate in airtight container for up to 3 days.

Meanwhile, in large pot of boiling saltedwater, cook noodles for 2 minutes less than package directions for al dente. Drain; lay noodles, without touching, in single layer on tea towel. Stir together ricotta, Parmesan cheese, egg, basil, garlic, salt and pepper. Set aside 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce. In 13- x 9-inch (3 L) baking dish, spread one-third of the remaining meat sauce. Arrange 3 noodles over top; sprinkle with 1 1/2 cups of the mozzarella cheese. Top with half of the remaining meat sauce, 3 noodles, ricotta mixture, 3 noodles, remaining meat sauce, then 3 noodles. Top with reserved meat sauce, then remaining mozzarella cheese.
