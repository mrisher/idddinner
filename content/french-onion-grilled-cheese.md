Grilled cheese is a near-perfect food on its own, but adding bacon, [kimchi](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019879-kimchi-grilled-cheese) or, in this case, heaps of caramelized onions really makes it special. Caramelizing onions takes a good half-hour, so save this recipe for when you have a little extra time and company (this recipe serves two). If time permits, you could even prep them ahead in a [slow cooker](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11170-caramelized-onions). Rather than layer the grated Gruyère and the warm caramelized onions in the sandwich, you should stir them together before assembling, which guarantees that the cheese will melt evenly throughout and that each bite will contain the perfect ratio of fragrant cheese to jammy onions. A splash of sherry, red-wine or white-wine vinegar added to the onions balances out the buttery flavors, but a side salad dressed with a tangy mustard vinaigrette would do the trick, too.

1.  Step
    
    1
    
    In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add the onions and season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook, stirring once or twice, until the onions are softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Uncover, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. If the onions look dry or like they might burn, add a few tablespoons of water at a time, scraping up any browned bits that are stuck to the bottom of the skillet. If desired, once the onions are done, deglaze the skillet with vinegar and cook until the liquid has evaporated, about 1 minute. Transfer the onions to a medium bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper. Wipe out the skillet, or wash it, if necessary.
    
2.  Step
    
    2
    
    Add the cheese to the onions and stir to combine. Put down two slices of bread, and scoop half of the cheese-onion mixture onto each one. Top with the remaining slices of bread, and press down gently.
    
3.  Step
    
    3
    
    In the skillet, melt 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Add the sandwiches and cook until the bottoms turn golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes, reducing the heat to prevent toast from darkening too quickly, if needed. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, flip the sandwiches, press down and cook until the cheese has fully melted and the bottoms turn golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately.

Caramelized onions freeze well. After I harvest onions in the early fall, I set up a table next to my gas grill. I put a big skillet on the side burner, add some oil. I cut up three pounds of so at a time and toss them in the skillet. Doing it on a breezy day keep the tears and smell at bay. After several batches, I let the caramelized onions cool and fill snack size Ziploc bags. Three bags fit into a quart freezer bag. They keep all winter.

A friend pointed this recipe out the other day and it fit the bill for a perfect, Lenten Friday, lunch. The wife approved with double thumbs up. My one tweak: I deglazed the pan with some bourbon. It's something I usually do if I am caramelizing onions. It's adds a nice vanilla sweetness.

Made these with homemade tomato soup and thought they were great. We had leftovers, so I made myself another soup and sandwich, but added some minced fresh dates to the onion and heated them again in a little butter. Wow! The very slight bitterness of onions was transformed. The added specs of sweetness to the combination of crisp bread, silky melted cheese and savory onions elevated this already excellent sandwich to something REALLY special. Give it a try. You’ll like it.

This is even better than French Onion Soup and you don't have to make beef broth! Will definitely make again.

Slice 3 pounds of onions and 1/2 stick of butter in your crockpot on high for 10 hours. Amazing! Extra goes in the freezer. Then, I made the grilled cheese also, amazing. I thought it needed a little extra salt.

Just didn't work for me. I felt like it needed something to make it a bit tastier so I used cranberry chutney and added a different kind of cheese. Won't make again.
