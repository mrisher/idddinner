Green Goddess Dressing

5/16/22

Parsley, 1.5 lemons, tahini, salt, pepper. Was great on basmati + salmon, but too thick.

*   Fresh herbs - I use parsley, cilantro, and dill, but mint, basil, and tarragon would all be delicious options!
*   Green onion - You’ll need the white and green parts, chopped.
*   Garlic - Roughly chopped: No need to mince as it’s going into the food processor!
*   Red pepper flakes - Optional, but I love the very subtle heat.
*   Tahini - My favorite [organic tahini](https://shop.themediterraneandish.com/product/organic-tahini-by-soom/) is nutty and nutritious, with a creamy texture.
*   Lemon juice - The juice of 2 lemons add just the right amount of tang.
*   Water - You’ll need anywhere from ¼ to 1 cup of water, depending on what consistency you want the green goddess dressing to be.
