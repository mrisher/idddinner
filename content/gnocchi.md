Gnocchi

PB comments from 4/20/2025

*   Kids loved the gnocchi! Came out so well – fingertip size. Use plenty of flour when rolling.
*   Didn’t make the brown butter sauce, but made a bunch of seared mushrooms and then threw some of the gnocchi in with the mushrooms. Used great mushrooms, but the kids didn’t love the mushrooms. Had some leftover tomato sauce that they enjoyed.
*   Still need to find a good sauce to accompany.

*   better if gnocchi are smaller. about the size of the first segment of a finger tip. Make them consistent for cooking purposes
*   added the whole cup of parmesan to the gnocchi mixture by accident, worked out pretty well
*   used cheap parmesan, was fine
*   couldn't really taste the nutmeg
*   added shallots to the sauce, cut down the butter dramatically and it was great

Sure, it’s great in lasagne, but ricotta realizes its true potential

in all kinds of pasta, such as this gnocchi. Watch food editor Gina

Marie Miraglia Eriquez demonstrate how to make your own fresh ricotta.

2 cups whole-milk ricotta (1 lb)

2 large eggs, lightly beaten

1 1/2 cups grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (3 oz), divided

1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg

1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour

1/2 stick unsalted butter

1 (2-inch) rosemary sprig

Stir together ricotta, eggs, 1 cup cheese, nutmeg, and 1/4

teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Add flour, stirring to form a soft,

wet dough.

Shape dough on a well-floured surface with lightly floured hands

into 2 (1-inch-thick) ropes. Cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces with a

lightly floured knife. Put in 1 layer on a lightly floured

parchment-lined baking sheet.

Cook gnocchi in 2 batches in a pasta pot of boiling salted water

(3 tablespoons salt for 6 quarts water), adding a few at a time to pot

and stirring occasionally, until cooked through (cut one in half to

check), 3 to 4 minutes per batch. Lift out with a slotted spoon and

drain in colander.

Meanwhile, cook butter with rosemary in a 12-inch heavy skillet

over medium-low heat until golden brown, about 5 minutes.

Toss gnocchi with brown butter in skillet and sprinkle with

remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Season with salt.
