### Instructions

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine brown rice flour, millet flour, tapioca starch, brown sugar, instant yeast, baking powder, xanthan gum, fruit pectin, and salt. Mix on low speed for 1 minute. Add water, ½ cup olive oil, egg whites, and vinegar and mix on high speed for 5 minutes, until the dough is smooth and shiny.

2 Transfer the dough to your prepared half-sheet pan. Using wet hands, pat the dough out so it evenly covers the sheet pan and reaches all the way into the corners. Drizzle

1-2 tablespoons of olive oil over the top and use your hands to spread the oil evenly over the surface of the dough.

3 Cover the dough with plastic wrap and allow to proof at room temperature for 20 minutes, then refrigerate overnight.

4 When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350°F. Drizzle 1-2 tablespoons more olive oil over the top and, using your fingers, gently "dimple" the dough. Poke straight down with your fingers rather than dragging or pulling your fingers through the dough.

Your dimples should reach about halfway through the dough. Sprinkle the top with Maldon salt.

5 Bake for 25-30 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through baking, until the bread is evenly golden brown with a crispy top. Allow the foccacia to cool before slicing. Extra bread can be frozen for up to 1 month or wrapped in plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 4 days. Re-toast before serving.

Variations

Festive Fruit: Add candied and dried fruits for a festive holiday bread. The sweetness of the fruit and the saltiness of the focaccia makes for a truly addictive treat. After the wet ingredients have been added, mix in 1 cup of your favorite fruits during the last minute of mixing. I like dried cranberries, candied orange peel, and candied lemon peel. Follow the same proofing and baking instructions.

Olive & Herb: Add olives and dried herbs to your focaccia for a wonderful savory addition.

After the wet ingredients have been added, mix in 1 cup of halved kalamata olives and 2 tablespoons herbs de provence during the last 1 minute of mixing. Follow the same proofing and baking instructions.

Sharp Cheddar & Black Pepper: Add sharp cheddar and black pepper to your basic dough for a spicy and savory treat. After the wet ingredients have been added, mix in 1 cup grated cheddar cheese and 1 tablespoon coarsely ground black pepper during the last 1 minute of mixing. Follow the same proofing and baking instructions.
