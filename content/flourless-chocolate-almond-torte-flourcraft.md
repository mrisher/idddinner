### Instructions

1 Preheat the oven to 325°F. Spray a 9-inch round cake pan with nonstick spray and line the bottom with parchment. In the microwave on high power, soften the almond paste and butter in a microwave-safe bowl until they both reach spreadable consistency, about 90 seconds.

2 In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix together the softened almond paste and butter at medium speed until smooth. With the mixer running on low speed, add the whole eggs, one at a time, and mix until the mixture is very smooth and the eggs are well combined. Add cocoa powder and salt and continue mixing on low speed until the mixture is homogeneous, about 2 minutes more. Transfer the almond-cocoa mixture to a large mixing bowl and set aside.

3 Clean the mixer bowl well and fit your mixer with the whisk attachment. Beat egg whites on high until foamy, 2-3 minutes.

Slowly sprinkle in the sugar and mix on high until stiff peaks form, 3-4 minutes more.

4 Using a large rubber spatula, fold one third of the beaten egg whites into the almond-cocoa mixture until combined. You don't have to be too thorough on this first addition. The idea is to bring the almond-cocoa mixture to a similar consistency as the egg whites so the remainder of the egg whites fold in easily without deflating.

5 Add the remaining two thirds of the beaten egg whites all at once to the large bowl.

Carefully fold egg whites into the almond-cocoa mixture, taking care not to deflate the whites while mixing. Once the egg whites are nicely folded in and no white streaks remain, pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Gently level off the top using a small offset spatula.

6 Bake for 30-40 minutes, until the torte is puffed up and feels set but not completely solid in the center. Allow to cool in the pan at least 30 minutes before inverting onto a serving platter. Don't worry if the cake sinks a bit as it cools. That is normal and it will still be delicious. Sprinkle with powdered sugar or cocoa powder before serving. If desired, serve with Cocoa Nib Cream (page 20).
