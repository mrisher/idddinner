Roasted cauliflower soup 
 
Ingredients 
1 large head cauliflower (about 2 pounds), cut into bite-size flo rets 
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided 
Fine sea salt 
1 medium red onion, chopped 
2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced 
4 cups (32 ounces) vegetable broth 
2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, or more if needed 
Scant ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg 
For garnish: 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh fla t-leaf parsley, chives and/or green 
onions 
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. If desired, line a large, rimmed baking 
sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup. 
On the baking sheet, toss the cauliflower with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil until lightly 
and evenly coated in oil. Arrange the cauliflo wer in a single layer and sprinkle lightly with 
salt. Bake until the cauliflower is tender and caramelized on the edges, 25 to 35 
minutes, tossing halfway. 

Once the cauliflower is almost done, in a Dutch oven or soup pot, warm the remaining 1 
tablespoon olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and ¼ teaspoon 
salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened and turning translucent, 5 to 
7 minutes. 
Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds, then add 
the broth. 
Reserve 4 of the prettiest roasted cauliflower florets for garnish. Then transfer the 
remaining cauliflower to the pot. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring the mixture 
to a simmer, then reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, 
stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, to give the fla vors time to meld. 
Once the soup is done cooking, remove the pot from the heat and let it cool for a few 
minutes. Then, carefully transfer the hot soup to a blender, working in batches if 
necessary. (Do not fill past the maximum fil l line or the soup could overflow!) 
Add the butter and blend until smooth. Add the lemon juice and nutmeg and blend again. 
Add additional salt, to taste (I usually add another ¼ to ¾ teaspoon, depending on the 
broth). This soup tastes amazing once it’s properly salted! You can also a little more 
lemon juice, if it needs more zing. Blend again. 
Top individual bowls of soup with 1 roasted cauliflo wer floret and a sprinkle of chopped 
parsley, green onion and/or chives. This soup keeps well in the refrigerator, covered, for 
about four days, or for several months in the freezer.

Apple sharlotka 
 
Butter or nonstick spray, for greasing pan 
6 large, tart apples, such as Granny Smiths 
3 large eggs 
1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour 
Ground cinnamon, to finish 
Powdered sugar, also to finish 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with 
parchment paper. Butter the paper and the sides of the pan. Peel, halve and core your 
apples, then chop them into medium-sized chunks. (I cut each half into four “strips” 
then sliced them fairly thinly — about 1/4-inch — in the other direction.) Pile the cut 
apples directly in the prepared pan. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, using an electric mixer 
or whisk, beat eggs with sugar until thick and ribbons form on the surface of the beaten 
eggs. Beat in vanilla, then stir in flour with a spoon until just combined. The batter will be 
very thick. 
Pour over apples in pan, using a spoon or spatula to spread the batter so that it covers 
all exposed apples. (Updated to clarify: Spread the batter and press it down into the 
apple pile. The top of the batter should end up level with the top of the apples.) Bake in 
preheated oven for 55 to 60 minutes, or until a tester comes out free of batter. Cool in 
pan for 10 minutes on rack, then flip out onto another rack, peel off the parchment 
paper, and flip it back onto a serving platter. Dust lightly with ground cinnamon. 
Serve warm or cooled, dusted with powdered sugar.

Marcella Hazan tomato sauce 
 
(actually takes like an hour, but a very low maintenance hour, mainly simmering; really good with 
homemade pasta) 
 
2 cups tomatoes, in addition to their juices (for example, a 28-ounce can of San Marzano whole 
peeled tomatoes) 
5 tablespoons butter 
1 onion, peeled and cut only in half 
Salt 
 
1. Combine the tomatoes, their juices, the butter and the onion halves in a 
saucepan. Add a pinch or two of salt. 
2. Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for about 45 
minutes. Stir occasionally, mashing any large pieces of tomato with a spoon.Add 
salt as needed. 
3. Discard the onion (some people may want to eat them separately).  David likes to 
use a hand blender to homogenize the sauce at this point.  This recipe makes 
enough sauce for a pound of pasta.

Sally’s Baking Addiction Homemade Bagels Recipe 
 
Recommended toppings: poppy seeds, sesame seeds, “everything bagel” topping 
(Trader Joe’s) 
Excellent with homemade chive cream cheese, lox, and fresh-squeezed orange juice 
 
Prep Time: 2 hours, 10 minutes 
 Cook Time: 25 minutes 
Total Time: 3 hours 
Yield: 8 bagels 
Make fresh bagels right at home with this tested dough recipe. Don’t skip the water bath 
and egg wash—both provide an extra chewy and golden brown crust.  
Ingredients 
1 and 1/2 cups (360g/ml) warm water (between 100–110°F/38–43°C) 
1 Tablespoon barley malt syrup, granulated sugar, or brown sugar* 
2 and 3/4 teaspoons (8g) instant or active dry yeast* 
4 cups (520g) bread flour (spooned & leveled), plus more as needed* 
2 teaspoons salt 
for coating the bowl: nonstick spray or 2 teaspoons butter or olive oil 
For Boiling & Topping 
2 quarts (1.9L) water 

1/4 cup (85g) barley malt syrup or honey 
egg wash: 1 egg white beaten with 1 Tablespoon water 
Instructions 
Prepare the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, 
whisk the warm water, barley malt syrup/sugar, and yeast together. Cover and allow to sit 
for 5 minutes. *If you don’t have a stand mixer, use a large mixing bowl and mix the 
dough with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula in the next step.* 
Add the flour and salt, and beat on medium speed for 2 minutes, until the dough comes 
together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. If it seems too sticky and clings to 
the sides of the bowl instead of forming a rough mass around the dough hook or spoon, 
add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue to mix until the dough pulls away 
from the sides of the bowl. The dough should be stiff and somewhat dry. If it is crumbly 
and breaks off in pieces, add more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, mixing well after each 
addition.
 
Knead the dough: When the dough has reached the proper consistency, beat on low 
speed with the dough hook for an additional 6–7 minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly 
floured surface for 6–7 minutes, until the dough feels smooth, supple, and elastic. (If 
you’re new to bread-making, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the 
dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flo ur at a 
time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky 
dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After 
kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly 
bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see 
if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece 
of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it 
up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough 

tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If 
not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test. 
Lightly grease a large bowl with nonstick spray, butter, or oil. Place the dough in the bowl, 
turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen 
towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 1.5–2 hours, or until doubled in 
size. 
Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. 
Shape the bagels: When the dough is risen, punch it down to release the air. On a lightly 
floured surface, divide the dough into 8 equal pieces, about 4 ounces (113g) each. 
Shape each piece into a ball. Press your index fin ger through the center of each ball to 
make a hole about 1.5–2 inches in diameter. Arrange the shaped bagels on the prepared 
baking sheets. Loosely cover the shaped bagels with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and 
let them rest for 5–10 minutes as you prepare the water bath. 
Preheat the oven to 425°F (218°C). 
Water bath: Fill a large, wide pot with 2 quarts (1.9L) of water. Whisk in the barley malt 
syrup or honey. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-high. Drop 2 
or 3 bagels in at a time, making sure they have enough room to flo at around. Boil the 
bagels for 1 minute, then use a spatula to flip each bagel over and boil for 1 minute 
more. Using a slotted metal spatula, lift the bagels out of the water, letting the excess 
water drain off. Place the bagels back on the lined baking sheets. Repeat with remaining 
bagels. 
Using a pastry brush, brush the egg wash on top and around the sides of each bagel. If 
you’re adding toppings, dip the tops of the bagels into the toppings immediately after 
applying the egg wash. 

Bake for 20–25 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through, until the bagels are dark 
golden brown. Allow the bagels to cool on the baking sheets for 20 minutes, then 
transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. 
Slice, toast, top, whatever you want! Cover leftover bagels tightly and store at room 
temperature for up to 4 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
