### Make the salad

1.  Preheat the oven to 400°F. Tightly wrap the beets in a double layer of aluminum foil and roast them on the bottom shelf of the oven for 1 1/2 hours, or until they are tender when pierced with the tip of a knife. When the beets are cool enough to handle, peel and cut them into 1-inch pieces.
    
2.  Meanwhile, divide the carrots, parsnips and turnips between 2 large rimmed baking sheets. Toss the vegetables in each pan with 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil. Arrange the onion wedges on the baking sheets, keeping them intact. Brush the onion wedges all over with the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Generously season the vegetables with salt and pepper. Roast the vegetables for 40 minutes. Brush the vegetables with the warm honey and sprinkle with the sage. Continue to roast the vegetables for 25 minutes longer, or until they are tender and glazed. Loosen the vegetables with a spatula and let them cool to room temperature in the pans.
    
3.  In a small bowl, mix the goat cheese with the herbs and olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
    
4.  In a small bowl, combine the olive oil with the vinegar, garlic and herbs; season with salt and pepper. In a large bowl, toss the arugula with 1 tablespoon of the vinaigrette and arrange on plates. Add the roasted vegetables (including beets) to the bowl and toss with the remaining vinaigrette. Top the arugula with the vegetables, dot each plate with small spoonfuls of the herbed goat cheese and serve.
    

About this recipe
-----------------

This fall harvest salad makes the most of seasonal root vegetables. Beets, carrots, parsnips, turnips, and onions mingle together to create the dish. They’re roasted until tender, brushed with honey and fresh sage, and then roasted some more until the glaze becomes sticky-sweet. Arranged on a bed of lightly dressed arugula and topped with herbed goat cheese, roasted root vegetable salad makes an elegant main course or side.

Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

### Should I boil root vegetables before roasting?

While some chefs call for par-boiling root vegetables before roasting them, this step isn’t necessary. If you set the oven to the optimal temperature (we think 400℉ to 425℉ is best for roasted vegetables) and use a generous amount of olive oil, the vegetables will brown on the outside as they cook through.

### What is the best way to eat root vegetables?

Although most root vegetables can be eaten raw, we think they taste even better when cooked. Roasted root vegetables glazed with maple syrup or honey is delicious during the fall season, and a classic mash is also comforting. You can also dice them into small pieces and stir into a soup or stew. If you really want to enjoy root vegetables such as carrots, parsnips, and turnips raw, slice them thin on a mandoline and scatter them over a crunchy salad.  

Notes from the Food & Wine Test Kitchen
---------------------------------------

Here’s how we peel beets easily in the test kitchen: Roast the beets, then let them rest for about 10 minutes before handling; you want them to be warm so they are easier to peel, but cool enough to handle comfortably. To peel, cup one beet in an old (but clean!) dish towel and rub the towel against the beet to remove the skin. Repeat with the remaining beets, then slice, dice, and serve.

Make ahead
----------

The herbed goat cheese and the vinaigrette can be refrigerated overnight. Bring the goat cheese to room temperature before serving the salad. The vegetables can be roasted earlier in the day and kept at room temperature.
