Ingredients for Instant Pot Jewish Noodle Kugel
-----------------------------------------------

*   [Extra Wide Egg Noodles](http://amzn.to/2CvKP9q)
*   Cottage Cheese and Sour Cream
*   Eggs
*   Raisins and Cinnamon
*   Sugar, Butter, Lemon Juice

What I love about the Pressure Cooker Jewish Noodle Kugel is that you can easily brown the top without ever turning on the oven just by using a Crisping Lid. Of course, if you prefer, go a head and pot the cooked kugel in the oven or in the air fryer and brown the top.

![Soak Raisins in Water to Plump](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20160708_192620.jpg "Soak Raisins in Water to Plump Image")

Soak Raisins in Water to Plump

Why Soak Raisins?
-----------------

*   Soaking raisins will plump them up and keep them from being very chewy.
*   The texture after cooking is much better.

If you do not want to soak the raisins, you do not have too. This is just a personal preference.

Both [Black Raisins](http://amzn.to/2j7LtCn) or [Golden Raisins](http://amzn.to/2kBDeic) can be used at the same time. Other types of dried fruit can be used too!

**Pro Tip:** For an interesting twist, soak the raisins (or whichever dry fruit you are using) in some brandy instead of water.

Various Dried Fruit To Use
--------------------------

*   [Diced Mix Fruit](https://amzn.to/3oWIJsD)
*   [Fruit Cake Fruit](http://amzn.to/2bmlqTV)
*   [Craisins Dried Cranberries](https://amzn.to/2LsDCh9)
*   Diced Apples
*   Diced Pineapples
*   [Dried Apricots](https://amzn.to/3vfPmId), chopped
*   [Sun Dried Fruit Medley](https://amzn.to/3oWIJsD) is really nice to use. It adds color and the combination of the dried fruit is super tasty.

Whichever dried fruit you choose to use, the first thing is to soak the fruit/raisins in fresh water. The raisins will plump and be nice in the kugel as opposed to chewy and hard from baking.

**Pro Tip:** Don’t use candied fruit (you know, the kind you would use for a [Christmas Holiday Fruitcake](https://thisoldgal.com/pressure-cooker-three-ingredient-holiday-fruitcake/)) when making kugel. It will be way too sweet.

[![Add the pasta to the Instant Pot or Pressure Cooker](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160817_141152.jpg "Add the pasta to the Instant Pot or Pressure Cooker Image")](https://amzn.to/3edKE8g)

Add the pasta to the Instant Pot or Pressure Cooker

The egg noodles will cook super fast, so don’t leave the kitchen.

To avoid the sputtering that sometimes happens when doing a quick release, use short, intermittent movements to release a little steam at a time.

**Pro Tip:** Running the cooked noodles under cold water will stop the cooking process. They need to be al dente since they are going back into the pressure cooker.

Lower Carb Option for Noodle Kugel
----------------------------------

Diabetics and those watching their carbohydrate and sugar intake, you could make a more diabetic friendly option.

*   Use [Miracle Noodles](http://amzn.to/2C10YVo). instead of pasta
*   Use a [Sugar Substitute](http://bit.ly/2WfOsPd) in place of white sugar
*   Swap the raisins out for diced peeled zucchini

**Pro Tip:** Cottage cheese still has some carbs, so please check the nutrition and eat according to your personal requirements.

![Beat Six Eggs Well](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20160708_193002.jpg "Beat Six Eggs Well Image")

Beat Six Eggs Well

I use a [Cuisinart Electric Hand Mixer](https://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KHM512ER-5-Speed-Ultra-Empire/dp/B009VUHLHA?tag=tog00-20) as it is so easy to just mix all the ingredients together and get them blended really well.

For all you who love to beat your eggs hard in my [Pressure Cooker New York Cheesecake](https://thisoldgal.com/pressure-cooker-new-york-cheesecake/) recipe, which you shouldn’t, here is your chance!! Hahahahaha.

![Dump in Filling Ingredients](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20160708_194344.jpg "Dump in Filling Ingredients Image")

Dump in Filling Ingredients

Add in the cottage cheese, sour cream, [cinnamon](https://www.amazon.com/Simply-Organic-Certified-2-45-Ounce-Container/dp/B000WS1KHM?tag=tog00-20), [sugar](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CJ8I9MC/US/tog00-20/?tag=tog00-20), [lemon juice](https://www.amazon.com/Realemon-100emon-Juice-15/dp/B007F1LWWC?tag=tog00-20) and the rest of the ingredients to the [Large Mixing Bowl](https://amzn.to/2GLXZ4U) and [beat](https://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KHM512ER-5-Speed-Ultra-Empire/dp/B009VUHLHA?tag=tog00-20) it really well so that there are no chunks of cottage cheese.

You will want a nice and smooth consistency.

![Drain Noodles, Rinse under Cold Water](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20160708_194023.jpg)

Drain Noodles, Rinse under Cold Water

By this time the noodles should be finished cooking. Drain the water and run the noodles under cold water.

![Dump in the Egg Noodles into Filling Mixture](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20160708_194645.jpg)

Gently fold the noodles into the [Large Mixing Bowl](https://amzn.to/2GLXZ4U) with the cottage cheese mixture and combine well.

Gently make sure all noodles are coated with the luscious filling

Can Other Noodles Be Used?
--------------------------

*   Yes. Very often when I make Pressure Cooker Jewish Noodle Kugel, I’ll use various shapes of pasta. For Chanukkah, I have used pasta shaped like dreidels and [Star of David/Jewish Star Pasta](https://amzn.to/3vibK4m).
*   For Christmas (oh, you would be surprised at how popular this kugel is at Christmas pot lucks) I use pasta in the shape of [Christmas Trees](https://amzn.to/3fmvaQ2). This ALWAYS goes over really well!
*   [Heart Shaped Pasta](https://amzn.to/35gc3RO) is super nice too!
*   You can even use plain old [Spaghetti Noodles](http://amzn.to/2B6Ak08) which are always fun to use.

Another wonderful recipe to bring to a potluck is my [Chocolate Chip Coffee Cake](https://thisoldgal.com/chocolate-chip-coffee-cake/), which is to die for…..really!

![Drained Raisins](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20160708_194827.jpg "Drained Raisins Image")

Drained Raisins

There are other fruit variations too. Using canned and fresh fruit gives the Instant Pot Jewish Noodle Kugel a different texture. Dried fruit has a chew to it, but fresh and canned fruit will generally blend in with the cheese mixture. It kinds of reminds me a fruit blintz.

Fresh and Canned Fruit Options
------------------------------

*   [Crushed Pineapple](https://amzn.to/2RUE5iS)
*   Diced Granny Smith Apples are super nice
*   Fresh or [Canned Apricot](https://amzn.to/3vlasVw)

**Pro Tip:** Fresh and canned fruit may not be as sweet and the sweetness (sugar) may need to be adjusted.

![Gently fold in the raisins Noodle Pudding](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160818_163133.jpg)

Gently fold in the raisins

Kugel is a Jewish dish, but so many of my friends who are not Jewish, use this dish for Christmas dinner. I have seen them use [Santa shaped pasta](https://www.amazon.com/Santas-Workshop-Novelty-Pasta-Package/dp/B017DIVOJ2?tag=tog00-20) and [cranberries](https://www.amazon.com/Ocean-Spray-Craisins-Cranberry-Ounce/dp/B00OAEVSTY?tag=tog00-20)!

![Pour half the mixture into the Push Pan](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160818_163500.jpg "Pour half the mixture into the Push Pan Image")

Pour half the mixture into the Push Pan

Generously, butter your [Push Pan](https://amzn.to/2YH0stn) so that the kugel will easily release.

Since the posting of this recipe, I have switched to using this [cake push pan with handles](https://amzn.to/2YH0stn). It makes is to easy to get the pan in and out of the pressure cooker.

**Pro Tip**: DO NOT USE PARCHMENT ROUNDS for the Kugel. While [Parchment Rounds](https://www.amazon.com/Worthy-Liners-Parchment-Paper-Round/dp/B00OWZXFP6?tag=tog00-20) are great when making [cheesecake](https://thisoldgal.com/perfect-pressure-cooker-cheesecake-tips/), it is not for making Kugel, as it will adhere and become one with the Kugel. Trust me on this! Don’t do it.

[![Pressure Cooker Jewish Noodle Kugel](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160818_174303.jpg "Pressure Cooker Jewish Noodle Kugel Image")](https://www.amazon.com/Fat-Daddios-Anodized-Aluminum-Cheesecake/dp/B0012Q5QQ4?tag=tog00-20)

Pressure Cooker Jewish Noodle Kugel

This is how the noodle kugel looks right out of the pressure cooker. Because I love the crispy top, here is what you do to make it nice and brown and crispy as if baked in the oven.

![Place the CrispLid on top of the Instant Pot](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Instant-Pot-Poor-Mans-Burnt-Ends-20.jpg "Place the CrispLid on top of the Instant Pot")

Place the CrispLid on top of the Instant Pot

After the Instant Pot Noodle Kugel is “baked” you will want to give the top a nice browning so that some of the noodles turn brown. The crispy part on top is the best! If you want the cornflake topping, add it now and then brown the top. If not using the cornflake topping, still, brown the top!

Browning the Top
----------------

*   Use a temperature of 350 degrees and place your Crisping Lid on top. Keep an eye on it, so that the kugel does not burn.
*   I recommend either of these two Crisping Lids:
    *   [Mealthy CrispLid](https://amzn.to/33D9zK0) (buy from Amazon)
    *   [Instant Pot Crisping Lid](https://amzn.to/2sZeush) (buy from Amazon)

[![Crisped Up Pressure Cooker Jewish Kugel](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160818_175346.jpg "Crisped Up Pressure Cooker Jewish Kugel Image")](https://www.amazon.com/Fat-Daddios-Anodized-Aluminum-Cheesecake/dp/B0012Q5QQ4?tag=tog00-20)

Crisped Up Pressure Cooker Jewish Kugel

Alternatively, you can put the Instant Pot Noodle Kugel under the broiler or use an air fryer to broth the top.

My preference is not adding the cornflake topping, but most people LOVE the topping, so try it both ways and see which you prefer.

Clearly, Instant Pot Jewish Noodle Kugel looks better after browning

How to Eat Jewish Noodle Kugel
------------------------------

*   My favorite way to eat Kugel, is at room temperature. You certainly can serve it directly from the [Instant Pot or Pressure Cooker](https://amzn.to/3edKE8g), if you like, but I suggest allowing it to get to room temperate.

**Pro Tip:** You can also make Kugel the day before and refrigerate it to serve with your meal.

How to Remove Kugel from Pan
----------------------------

*   Before removing the sides from the Kugel, allow it to set up a while, about an hour. It may be fine to remove the pan right away; I just never tried, so I can’t speak to that…..
*   Take any can or jar and place the [Push Pan](https://amzn.to/2YH0stn) on top and pull the ring down. The Kugel will appear like magic. I use a really [Thin Slotted Turner](https://www.amazon.com/Lamson-Slotted-Turner-Stainless-Riveted/dp/B00004WGUM?tag=tog00-20) to remove the Kugel off the bottom of the [Push Pan](https://amzn.to/2YH0stn) and on to a plate.

Yummy Pressure Cooker Jewish Noodle Kugel

Yummy Instant Pot Noodle Kugel can be served hot, warm, room temperature or cold. My favorite way is room temperature. For those who do not keep Kosher, but love Jewish food, Instant Pot Kugel goes great with my [Friday Night Shabbos Brisket](https://thisoldgal.com/pressure-cooker-friday-night-shabbos-brisket/).

Bring Instant Pot Noodle Kugel to a buffets or to a BBQ. It is also great as desert or just for a snack. It is a great “make a head” dish!

Besides brisket, Kugel goes really well with [London Broil](https://thisoldgal.com/grilled-london-broil/) or [Grilled Tri-Tip!](https://thisoldgal.com/santa-maria-style-barbecue-grilled-tri-tip/)  Enjoy.

*   Soak raisins in a bowl of water to plump.
    
*   Add egg noodles and water to just barely cover the noodles to Pressure Cooker cooking pot.
    
*   Lock on lid and close Pressure Valve.  Cook at High Pressure for 1 minute.  When Beep sounds, do a Quick Release by carefully using intermittent movements to toggle the Pressure Valve open and close, to avoid spewing liquid.
    
*   Immediately, rinse under cool water to stop the cooking. Set aside.
    

#### Filling

*   Beat or whisk eggs.  Add cottage cheese, sour cream, sugar, cinnamon, salt, lemon juice and beat well.  Fold cooked noodles into mixture.
    
*   Drain water from raisins and fold into mixture.
    
*   Generously grease your Push Pan,  Pour noodle mixture into Push Pan and dot with butter.
    
*   Add 1.5 cups of water to Pressure Cooker cooking pot and place in a trivet.  Place Kugel on top of trivet.
    
*   Lock on Lid and close Pressure Valve.  Cook at High Pressure for 20 minutes.
    
*   When Beep sounds, allow a 15 minute Natural Pressure Release.
    
*   Open lid and if using topping, add it now.
    
*   Place Mealthy Crisplid on top of pressure cooker. Set temperature to 375 degrees and cook for 5 minutes.
    

#### Topping (optional)

*   Crush corn flakes and mix with sugar and cinnamon.  Sprinkle over the top of noodle mixture and dot with butter prior to crisping.
    

Both [Black Raisins](http://amzn.to/2j7LtCn) or [Golden Raisins](http://amzn.to/2kBDeic) can be used at the same time. Other types of dried fruit can be used too! Play around with the recipe and use different types of dried fruit and pasta shapes for special occassions.

### Various Dried Fruit Can Be Used

*   [Diced Mix Fruit](https://amzn.to/3oWIJsD)
*   [Fruit Cake Fruit](http://amzn.to/2bmlqTV)
*   [Craisins Dried Cranberries](https://amzn.to/2LsDCh9)
*   Diced Apples
*   Diced Pineapples
*   [Sun Dried Fruit Medley](https://amzn.to/3oWIJsD) is really nice to use. It adds color and the combination of the dried fruit is super tasty.

Running cold water over the cooked noodles will stop the cooking process, so that the noodles do not become over cooked during pressure cooking of the kugel.

After the Instant Pot Noodle Kugel is "baked" you will want to give the top a nice browning so that some of the noodles turn brown. The crispy part on top is the best! If you want the cornflake topping, add it now and then brown the top. If not using the cornflake topping, still, brown the top!

### Browning the Top

*   Use a temperature of 350 degrees and place your Crisping Lid on top. Keep an eye on it, so that the kugel does not burn.
*   I recommend these two Crisping Lids:
    *   [Mealthy CrispLid](https://amzn.to/33D9zK0) (buy from Amazon)
    *   [Instant Pot Crisping Lid](https://amzn.to/2sZeush) (buy from Amazon)

Any type of pasta or semolina noodle is fine to use in this recipe. If using a different shape of pasta or noodle, your cook time will be different.  I particularly like to use spaghetti noodles and use a [9 Inch Springform Pan](https://amzn.to/3hmIFhk)! It is really pretty when you cut into the kugel.

### Macaroni and Noodle Options

*   [Spaghetti Noodles](http://amzn.to/2B6Ak08) are always fun to use.
*   [Star of David/Jewish Star Pasta](https://amzn.to/3vibK4m)
*   [Christmas Tree Pasta](https://amzn.to/3fmvaQ2) - I like to use this for office holiday parties. When I do, I use the tree pasta with cranberries, making it very festive
*   [Gingerbread Man Shaped Macaroni](https://amzn.to/3fKeQYl)
*   [Bunny Shaped Pasta](https://amzn.to/34k0d8J)

### This Old Gal's Pasta Rule of Thumb

*   Look at package of pasta and find the variable cook time. Choose the lesser time given and then subtract 2 minutes. For example, if your package of pasta says "cook for 8 - 11 minutes," take that 8 minute number and cut it in half, which is 4. Then subtract 2 minutes from the 4 minutes and you will end up with the proper cook time. In this example the cook time will be 2 minutes.
*   After the 2 minute pressure cook time is up, wait 5 minutes and then release the rest of the pressure.
*   If the variable cook time on your package of pasta is 11 - 16 minutes, err on the lesser side. In this instance, the cook time would be 3 minutes. It is better to end up with overly firm pasta rather than mushy because you can continue to cook the pasta, but if it is mushy, there is nothing you can do to correct.
*   If the pasta is too firm or al dente for your taste, simply put the lid back on the pot and let the pasta sit in the hot pot.  The residual heat will continue to cook the pasta. Check after a few minutes to see if the pasta has reached the perfect firmness for your liking. If not give it a stir and let sit some more.

This recipe uses a bit of a natural release and the total time is figured into that, so only the cook time needs to be adjusted. The natural release time allows for a little pressure to release, so that the starchy water can settle and not spit out through the pressure valve when the pressure is released.
