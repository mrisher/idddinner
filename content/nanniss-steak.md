2.4 lb ny strip steak?

Two methods. Both work. Both start the same way:

On the steak: melted butter. Salt. Pepper. (That order). Think you’re using enough salt? You’re probably not. That’s probably 1lb of meat. You need a lot. It should look like a light snowfall has covered the steak. Press the salt and pepper into the steak.

Note: steak must be room temp. Let it sit on the counter before you butter/salt/pepper.

Method 1 (sear baby sear). This is the closest to what a steakhouse does in their 1800 degree ovens. Get the heaviest best pan you own and put some Canola/Veggie oil in there. No, not olive oil. Olive oil smokes at a lower heat and you’re gonna heat the shit out of this.

Crank the burner to high and when the oil shimmers put the steak in the pan. It will smoke. A lot. Best to do this outside with a pan on the grill if you can get it hot enough.

3-4 min per side for rare/med rare depending on thickness and for FUCK sake sear the meaty sides too. When done let it sit 6-9min. Thicker steak? Longer cook time? LONGER REST.

If you want to finish it with some good quality olive oil drizzle that shit on top right before serving. But if you bought a good steak you won’t need it.

Method 2 (the reverse sear).

Season steak as above.

Put it on a baking cooling rack on a baking sheet and put it in a 200degree oven for 1 hour.

It will come out looking grey/brown. That’s okay.

Now, sear it as above - taking 1-2 minutes off sear time. Rest it as above.

Method 2 has a lower chance of overcooking which is why i like it.

Steak sauce:

Ok. Steak is perfectly charred, but you’ve got some awesome juices and black bits in the pan. Dumping it seems a waste - because it is. Here’s what you do:

Leave pan on stove and reduce heat to about medium. Sometimes i do Med-high.

Add one diced shallot. Garlic will burn and onions are boring. Move the shallot around in the pan - they may get a bit black (that’s fine) and they’ll give off some liquid (that’s what you want).

Then add 1/4 to 1/3 cup of red wine. This will steam like crazy (obv) but use the alcohol to scrape up all the yummy bits that have stuck to the pan.

Once all the bits are up and the wine is reduced (but not evaporated) add ~2 tbls of butter. Make sure it’s cubed into 8+ pieces and cold. refrigerator cold - not freezer cold.

Swirl that around until melted. Then add 1/4 cup of stock (beef preferred, but veggie works here too). It should all come together.

It thickens up and bubbles happily - then plate the steak and cover it with the sauce.

Variations: after the butter but before the stock you can add stuff. Stuff is fairly unlimited, but i like:

Heaping tbl of good dijon mustard

Handful of thyme sprigs (to be removed before playing)

Cooked/browned mushrooms

I’ve subbed sherry for wine and that works well too - gives a nuttier taste and complements mushrooms well.

This method is also a bit more feel than science. I don’t use the measurements above exactly, so they may be a bit off. The sauce is good when you drag your spoon across the bottom of the pan and the trail doesn’t fill in immediately.
