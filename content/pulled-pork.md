*   Only a handful of common ingredients are required to make this versatile pork.
*   Searing the pork shoulder first adds deep flavor and an appealing brown crust.
*   The result is tender, easy-to-shred meat perfect for tacos or sandwiches.

This simple recipe yields tender, shredded, melt-in-your-mouth pork—a perfect base for adding seasonings and ideal for making delicious sandwiches, tacos, and egg rolls. Normally, pork shoulder takes several hours in the oven or slow cooker, but when made in the Instant Pot, the pork cooks in just over an hour. You no longer need to save this dish for the weekend. Plus, using the sauté setting allows you to sear the meat first to create a deep brown crust, which enhances both flavor and texture.

The Spruce Eats / Diana Rattray

Pork shoulder is a tougher cut of meat compared to the rib or loin. However, this makes it more affordable. When cooked properly—typically "low and slow"—it becomes fork-tender, perfect for shredding and adding to a variety of dishes.

Can You Overcook Pork in the Instant Pot?
-----------------------------------------

It is more common to undercook pork in the Instant Pot than overcook it. If the meat seems tough, it is most likely undercooked and needs additional time.

"Cooking a pork shoulder in the Instant Pot makes it nearly effortless, and super fast, too. This recipe turned out very flavorful and was perfect for pulled pork sandwiches. I just mixed the meat with barbecue sauce after cooking and piled it on buns." —[Danielle Centoni](https://www.thespruceeats.com/danielle-centoni-4788046)
