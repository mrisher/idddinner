BREAKFAST 
Lemon Blueberry Bread 
5 tbsp melted butter 
1 cup sugar 
1 lemon, zested and juiced 
2 eggs 
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
1 tsp baking powder 
1 tsp kosher salt 
1/2 cup whole milk 
1 cup blueberries 
1.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray a loaf pan with baking/nonstick spray. 
2.In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or large bowl with a 
wooden spoon, combine the butter, sugar, lemon zest and juice then mix in 
the eggs. 
3.In a separate small bowl, sift together 1 1/2 cups of flour, baking powder and 
salt. 
4.Add 1/3 of the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Once combined, mix in 
half of the milk followed by another 1/3 of dry ingredients, the other half of 
the milk and then the rest of the dry ingredients. 
5.Toss the blueberries in the remaining 2 tbsp of flour then gently fold into the 
batter. 
6.Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan and bake for about one hour, until 
the top is golden brown, the sides start to pull away from the pan and when a 
toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. 
7.Let cool in the pan for 20 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool 
completely. 
8.If desired, top with a glaze made with 1/4 cup powdered sugar and some 
lemon juice.

Mike’s Monkey Bread 
makes a bundt pan or a 9" X 9" casserole dish 
4 tins Pillsbury biscuits  or 2 tins of 
Pillsbury Grands  
½ cup white sugar 
½ tsp ground cinnamon 
1½ sticks of butter 
1 cup brown sugar 
1 tbsp ground cinnamon 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease up a bundt pan or a 9" X 9" casserole 
dish.  Pam will do, but butter is better. Just pop open tins and cut biscuits them 
into quarters.  Put those quarter pieces into a bag or bowl with white sugar and 
1 tsp of cinnamon, shake it all about, and transfer to your dish.   
Put ¾-cup butter (about 1½ sticks), brown sugar, and 1 tbs of cinnamon into a 
sauce pan and melt them down into a smooth, uniform caramel sauce.  Pour 
your sauce over the biscuits; it will be a lot of sauce.  Bake for about 30 minutes 
(or until it stops expanding and the caramel sets on the outside).  Wait at least 
10 minutes, then dump out of your dish onto a plate and serve!  If you don't 
wait, you'll have monkey mess on your hands.

Pamela Salzman Granola 
3 cups old fashioned rolled oats (not 
instant or quick-cooking) 
½ cup unsweetened, dried coconut 
flakes 
⅓ cup raw pumpkin seeds 
⅓ raw sunflower seeds 
2 tbsp sesame seeds 
1 tsp ground cinnamon 
¼ tsp fine grain sea salt 
¼ cup melted unrefined coconut oil 
⅓ cup 100% pure maple syrup 
¼ cup honey 
1 tsp pure vanilla extract 
1 cup raw almonds 
1.Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with unbleached 
parchment paper. 
2.In a large bowl stir together the oats, coconut flakes, seeds, cinnamon and 
salt. 
3.In a small bowl, whisk together the melted coconut oil, maple syrup, brown 
rice syrup and vanilla. It is really important to mix the oil and syrups so that 
everything is well blended otherwise the syrups may burn. Add the oil and 
syrup mixture to the oats and stir to coat well. 
4.Transfer the oat mixture to the prepared pan. Bake for 25-35 minutes (ovens 
vary), stirring occasionally until golden brown. The mixture will not be crunchy 
yet. Add the chopped nuts and dried fruit to the pan and allow to cool. 
Transfer granola to an airtight container and store at room temperature or 
freeze.

PIZZA and PASTA  
Easy Homemade Pizza Dough 
Bless this Mess Blog 
2 1/2 cups warm water 
1 tbsp yeast 
1 tbsp sugar 
1 tsp salt 
1/4 cup olive oil 
6 to 6 1/2 cups flour 
1.In a large mixing bowl, add the water, yeast, sugar, salt, and olive oil. 
Allow mixture to stand for 5 minutes. 
2.Add one cup of flour, and mix to combine. Add another cup of flour 
and mix through. Mix by hand for 1 or 2 minutes. The dough should 
be the consistency of cake batter. Add another cup of flour and mix 
until well combined. Add flour until you can’t mix it by hand very well. 
3.Sprinkle some flour on your table and turn the dough onto the table. 
Knead the dough by hand until it is smooth and elastic, adding flour 
as needed. This should take 6 to 10 minutes of kneading. You can also 
do this part in a stand mixer if you have one. 
4.Place the dough back in the bowl, cover it with a towel, and let it rise 
in a warm place for 15 to 60 minutes (This time varies a lot for me – I 
just let it rise according to how long it is until dinner time). 
Half Easy Homemade Pizza Dough

Easy Spaghetti With Meat Sauce 
Makes: 4 Servings | 30 min | New York Times 
 
Kosher salt and black pepper 
2 tbsp olive oil 
1medium yellow onion, finely chopped 
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped 
½ lb ground beef (preferably 20 percent fat), pork or dark meat turkey 
12 oz spaghetti, pappardelle or other long pasta 
¼ cup tomato paste 
2 tsp Worcestershire sauce 
Grated Parmesan, for serving 
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Heat oil in a large skillet over 
medium-high. Add onion, garlic and ½ tsp salt and cook, stirring often, until 
beginning to soften, 3 minutes. Add beef and cook, breaking up with a wooden 
spoon, until no longer pink, about 3 minutes. 
  
Add pasta to the pot and cook according to package instructions until al dente. 
 
Meanwhile, add tomato paste to skillet and cook, stirring, until darkened, about 
1 minute. Add 1 cup water, Worcestershire, ½ tsp pepper and ½ tsp salt and 
simmer until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. 
 
Using tongs, transfer pasta directly from the pot to the skillet along with 1 cup 
pasta water. Increase heat to high and simmer vigorously, tossing, until sauce 
reduces and coats the pasta, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper. Serve with Parmesan.

Roasted Red Pepper Pasta  
2 red bell peppers (~119 g each) 
2-3 tbsp (30-45 ml) olive oil 
2 shallots, finely chopped (~1/4 c or 
40 g) 
4 cloves garlic, finely chopped (2 tbsp 
or 12 g) 
Sea salt and ground black pepper 
1 1/2 cups (360 ml) cream 
Pinch red pepper flake (optional, for 
heat) 
12 oz (340 g) linguini or spaghetti 
1.Heat oven to 500 degrees F and roast red peppers on a baking sheet 
until charred - about 25-30 minutes. Cover in foil for 10 minutes to steam, 
and then remove (peel away) charred skin, seeds and stems. Set aside. 
While the red peppers are roasting, bring a large skillet over medium heat 
and sauté onion and garlic in 2-3 Tbsp olive oil until golden brown and 
soft - about 4-5 minutes. Season with a generous pinch of salt and 
pepper and stir. Remove from heat and set aside. 
2.Cook pasta according to package instructions; drain, toss in a touch of 
olive oil, cover with a towel and set aside.  
3.Transfer sautéed shallot and garlic to blender with roasted peppers, 
cream, and red pepper flake. Season with desired amount of salt, pepper 
and red pepper flake. Blend until creamy and smooth, taste and adjust 
seasonings as needed.  
4.Once blended, place sauce back in the skillet over medium heat to 
thicken. Once it reaches a simmer, reduce heat to low and continue 
simmering. Once sauce is thickened to desired consistency, add noodles. 
However, before tossing add a touch more olive oil, salt and pepper to 
the un-tossed noodles for added flavor. Then, toss to coat. Serve with 
(generous amounts of) Parmesan, red pepper flake and fresh chopped 
parsley or basil.

Orecchiette with Peas & Pancetta  
~30 min total 
1 tbsp olive oil 
1 (4-ounce) packages diced pancetta 
4-6 cloves garlic, minced  
1 cup frozen peas, thawed 
1 cup heavy cream 
1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese 
1 lbs box orecchiette pasta 
1.Bring a large pot of water with a tbsp of salt to a boil over high heat. 
2.While the water comes to a boil, heat a large skillet over medium-low 
heat. Add the olive oil and diced pancetta. Cook, stirring every couple of 
minutes, until the fat renders and the pancetta gets crispy and golden 
brown, about 10 minutes. 
3.Once crispy, add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about a 
minute. 
4.Add the peas and cook until they turn bright green, about a minute more. 
(If you notice the garlic starting to turn more than light golden brown, 
don’t wait and add the cream now to avoid burning the garlic!) 
5.Your water should be boiling by now, so add the pasta, give it a good stir 
to ensure it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pot and cook according to 
the package directions. I like to use orecchiette as the peas and pancetta 
cling to these “little ears” beautifully. 
6.Next, if you haven't done so already, add the cream to your skillet and 
bring to a simmer. Once little bubbles start to form around the edges of 
the skillet, stir in the Parmesan cheese. Add some freshly ground pepper 
and adjust seasonings to taste. Remember, the pancetta and cheese are 
both salty, so you may or may not need to add more salt.   
7.Once your pasta is al dente, use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer the 
soaking wet pasta to the sauce. You want this extra pasta cooking liquid 
to help thin the sauce and continue cooking the pasta.   
8.Stir well to coat the pasta in the sauce. Taste and adjust seasonings to 
your liking. I usually add some more salt and freshly ground pepper. Let 
the pasta soak up the sauce a couple minutes before serving.

Fusilli alla Vodka with Basil and Parmesan   
Jon and Vinny’s 
1/4 cup olive oil  
1 small shallot, finely minced 
1 garlic clove, finely minced 
1/2 cup tomato paste 
2 tbsp vodka 
1 cup heavy cream 
1 tsp red pepper flakes, or to taste 
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper 
1 lbs fusilli 
2 tbsp butter 
1 ounce freshly ground Parmesan 
cheese, plus more for serving  
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil 
  
1.Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shallot and 
a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 
minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more, until fragrant. Add 
the tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until thick, brick-red and 
starting to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Add the vodka and cook, stirring 
constantly, until the liquid is mostly evaporated, about 2 minutes. Add the 
cream and red pepper flakes, stirring to fully combine. Season with salt 
and pepper to taste.  
2.While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over 
high heat; once boiling, add the fusilli and cook, stirring occasionally, until 
just shy of al dente according to package directions. Reserve 1 cup of 
pasta water before draining the pasta.  
3.Transfer the drained pasta to the skillet with the sauce; add the butter and 
enough pasta water to thin the sauce slightly. Cook over medium-low 
heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens and the pasta is al dente, 
about 2 minutes. Add more pasta water if needed to thin the sauce. 
Season with salt and pepper and add the 1 ounce of Parmesan cheese, 
tossing to coat. Serve with additional ground Parmesan and chopped 
fresh basil.

1 medium shallot, roughly chopped 
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper 
1/4 cup (2 ounces) dry white wine 
2 cups heavy cream 
Pasta 
12 ounces bucatini 
3 tbsp olive oil 
1 lb mild or spicy Italian sausage, 
casings removed 
1/4 lb fresh oyster mushrooms, sliced 
(about 2 cups) 
1/4 lb fresh shiitake mushrooms, 
stems removed and sliced (about 2 
cups) 
1 medium shallot, finely chopped 
(about 1/4 cup) 
4 large garlic cloves, minced (about 3 
tbsp) 
1/4 cup (2 ounces) dry white wine 
1/2 cup chicken stock 
1/2 tsp kosher salt 
1/2 tsp black pepper 
2 tsps grated lemon zest, plus 2 tbsp 
fresh lemon juice, divided 
  
1.Make the shiitake cream sauce: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. 
Add oyster mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, garlic, shallot, and crushed 
red pepper; cook, stirring often, until fragrant and softened, about 4 
minutes. Add wine; cook, stirring constantly, until liquid is almost 
completely reduced, 1 to 2 min. Stir in cream, and bring to a simmer over 
medium (do not boil). Reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring often, until 
mushrooms are tender and cream is slightly reduced, about 10 min.  
2.Transfer mushroom mixture to a blender. Secure lid, and remove center 
piece to allow steam to escape. Place a clean towel over opening; 
process until smooth, about 1 minute. Pour mixture through a fine wire-
mesh strainer set over a medium heatproof bowl; discard solids. Cover 
and set aside.  
3.Make the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high. Add 
pasta, and cook according to package directions for al dente. Drain pasta, 
reserving 3/4 cup cooking liquid.

4.Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Add sausage, and 
cook, stirring often to break into small crumbles, until browned, 4 to 5 
minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sausage to a medium bowl; 
reserve drippings in skillet.  
5.Heat skillet with drippings over medium-high. Add oyster and shiitake 
mushrooms; cook until golden brown on both sides, about 6 minutes, 
flipping halfway through. Stir in shallot and garlic; cook, stirring 
constantly, until fragrant and softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in reserved 
sausage. Add wine, scraping up browned bits from bottom of skillet. Stir 
in stock, salt, and pepper; bring to a simmer over medium-high. Reduce 
heat to medium, and cook until liquid is slightly reduced, 1 to 2 minutes.  
6.Stir shiitake cream sauce into sausage mixture in skillet; bring to a gentle 
simmer over medium. Add pasta, and toss until sauce coats noodles, 
adding reserved pasta water, 1/4 cup at a time, as needed to reach 
desired consistency. Stir in lemon juice. Divide pasta evenly among 4 
bowls; top with lemon zest and additional black pepper. Serve 
immediately.

Creamy Swiss Chard Pasta With Leeks, Tarragon and Lemon Zest 
¾ lbs green Swiss chard (1 large 
bunch), washed and trimmed 
2 large leeks (10 to 12 ounces each) 
5 tbsp unsalted butter 
½ cup panko bread crumbs 
Kosher salt and black pepper 
3 tbsp nutritional yeast

pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden and toasted, 3 to 4 
minutes. Stir in nutritional yeast, then transfer to a paper towel-lined 
plate. 
4.Wipe out the skillet. Add the remaining 3 tbsps butter and melt over 
medium-high. Add the leeks, chard stems, garlic and thyme, season with 
salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until leeks start to wilt 
and soften, about 5 minutes. Add the torn chard, season with salt and 
pepper, and cook, stirring, until just wilted, 2 minutes. 
5.Add the stock and heavy cream, and boil over high until thickened, about 
10 minutes. 
6.Once the mixture is simmering, add the pasta to the pot of boiling water 
and cook until al dente. Drain pasta. 
7.Transfer chard mixture to the empty pasta pot. Stir in the cooked pasta, 
then sprinkle with the Parmesan, stirring vigorously to melt it into the 
sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
8.Divide among shallow bowls or plates. Sprinkle generously with the 
prepared bread crumbs, top with tarragon and grate fresh lemon zest on 
top. Serve immediately.

1 tsp baking powder 
Freshly ground black pepper 
Pinch of cayenne 
1 egg 
Olive or vegetable oil, for frying 
Garlic Lemon Cream 
1/2 cup sour cream 
1 garlic clove, minced 
1 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice 
Pinch freshly grated lemon zest 
Salt 
1.Fill a bowl with cold water.  Cut the leeks in half lengthwise and plunge them

cut crosswise into 1/4-inch strips. 
2.Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the leeks for 3 to 4 minutes, 
until they are softened but not limp.   
3.While they are cooking, whisk together the flour, baking powder, a few grinds 
of black pepper, ginger, and cayenne. 
4.Drain the leeks and dry in a towel or cheesecloth.  Make sure to get rid of as 
much water as possible. 
5.Transfer the leeks to a large mixing bowl and add scallions.  Add the flour 
mixture to the leeks and toss to coat.  Add the egg and stir until it is 
incorporated with the mixture.

6 Potato Slider Buns 
2 lbs Chicken Breasts 
¼ cup Buttermilk 
½ cup Panko Breadcrumbs 
1.Preheat the toaster oven to 350°F. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Slice 
each slider bun in half lengthwise. Cut each chicken breast into thirds. 
2.Place the chicken pieces in a small bowl with the buttermilk. Set aside to

Mustard Milanese with an Arugula Fennel Salad 
Time: 75 min | Smitten Kitchen 
For the chicken: 
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts 
salt and pepper 
1/2 cup all purpose flour 
1 large egg white 
2 tbsp Dijon mustard (smooth) 
2 garlic cloves (minced) 
1 tsp dried oregano 
1/2 tsp grated lemon zest (fresh) 
1 1/2 cups panko 
Mix of vegetable/olive oil, for frying 
For the salad: 
3 tbsp lemon juice (freshly 
squeezed, from 1 large lemon) 
2 Tbsp. seed (whole-, or coarse 
Dijon mustard) 
1 tbsp Dijon mustard (smooth) 
1/4 cup olive oil 
5 oz baby arugula 
Small fennel bulb 
1.Butterfly your chicken breasts, so that you end up with four thin cutlets. Lbs 
your cutlets out between two pieces of plastic wrap to 1⁄4-inch thickness. 
Season the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. 
2.Grab three big plates, and line them up on your counter. Pour the flour into 
the first one. In a small dish, whisk together the egg white, smooth Dijon, 
garlic, oregano, and lemon zest. Pour half of this mixture into the bottom of 
the second plate. In the third plate, spread out the breadcrumbs. Dredge 
each piece of chicken lightly in flour, then heavily in the egg-white– mustard 
mixture, and generously in the breadcrumbs. 
3.Repeat with second piece of chicken, then refill egg-white–mustard plate, 
and repeat with final two pieces of chicken. Arrange cutlets on a tray, and 
chill them in the fridge for 1 hour, or up to 1 day (covered with plastic wrap). 
4.Preheat your oven to 175. Pour 1⁄2 inch of oil in a large pan and heat over 
medium-high heat. Test with a flick of water—if it hisses, you’re good to go. 
Cook the chicken until golden brown (about 3-4 minutes on first and 2-3 
minutes on second). Remove the chicken from heat, and salt and pepper on 
both sides while draining on paper towels. Once it’s drained, transfer to a 
tray to keep in the warm oven. Repeat with more oil and remaining chicken. 
5.In a small bowl, whisk lemon juice and mustards together, then whisk in olive 
oil in a thin stream. Pour three-quarters of this into a large bowl. Add arugula 
to bowl. Thinly shave your fennel bulb on a mandoline, or cut it as thinly as 
you can with a sharp knife, and add this to the arugula. 
6.When you’re ready to serve it, toss the salad. Arrange one piece of chicken 
from the warm oven on a plate. Drizzle a few drops of the reserved salad 
dressing directly onto the chicken, and pile the salad on top. Season with salt 
and pepper, and eat immediately.

Maple BBQ Drumsticks  
8 chicken drumsticks (about 
2 lbs total), patted 
dry 
Salt and pepper 
Maple Barbecue Sauce 
(recipe follows) 
1.Preheat the oven to 425°F, with one rack in the middle and another so 
that the chicken will be 3 to 4 inches from the broiler. Put the chicken on a 
sheet pan (lined with foil for easier cleanup, if you like). Season with salt 
and pepper and arrange top-side up and in alternating directions. Roast 
on the middle rack until golden brown, about 20 minutes. 
2.Brush some of the Maple Barbecue Sauce on the drumsticks, then flip 
them over and brush the other side. Roast until cooked through, about 10 
minutes more. Remove from the oven and preheat the broiler. Flip the 
drumsticks over again, brush with more sauce, and broil on the upper rack 
until the sauce caramelizes, keeping a close eye on them to prevent 
burning, about 1 minute. Serve hot or at room temperature. 
1 tbsp olive oil 
1 small yellow onion, finely 
chopped 
1 garlic clove, minced 
1 tsp salt 
Pinch of cayenne pepper 
½ tsp turmeric 
⅔ cup ketchup 
2 tbsp maple syrup 
½ cup apple cider vinegar 
2 tbsp whole-grain 
mustard 
1 tbsp Worcestershire 
sauce 
Grated zest and juice of 1 lime 
Pepper 
3.In a medium saucepan, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Add the 
onion, garlic, and salt and cook until the onion is softened, about 8 
minutes. Add the cayenne and turmeric and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 
about 30 seconds. Add the ketchup, maple syrup, vinegar, mustard, 
Worcestershire sauce, and lime zest and stir to combine 
4.Bring the sauce to a simmer, then season with lime juice, salt, and pepper. 
If the sauce needs more acid, add more vinegar or lime juice; if it needs 
more sweetness, add more maple syrup. If you're not using the sauce 
right away, let cool and transfer to a covered container. The Maple 
Barbecue Sauce will keep, covered in the refrigerator, for about 4 days. If 
serving as a dipping sauce, warm before using.

Chicken Shawarma  
Pamela Saltzman 
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil 
¼ cup lemon juice (~2 lemons) 
2 tsp kosher salt 
2 tsp ground cumin 
2 tsp paprika 
½ tsp ground turmeric 
⅛ tsp ground cinnamon, or 
more to taste 
⅛ tsp cayenne pepper, or 
more if you want it to be spicy 
Several grinds of black pepper 
4 garlic cloves, minced 
2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken 
thighs, trimmed of excess fat 
White sauce (recipe follows) 
Lavash/Pita 
Romaine hearts 
1.Prepare the marinade: Combine all the marinade ingredients in a 
nonreactive bowl (e.g., glass). Add the chicken and toss to coat. Marinate 
at room temperature for 1 hour or in the refrigerator for several hours or 
up to overnight. 
2.Remove the chicken from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking. 
Preheat the oven to 400F or a heat a grill to medium heat. If you are 
baking, line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 
3.Grill until cooked through, about 7 minutes on each side, or bake on the 
prepared baking sheet for 35 minutes, or until cooked through. If the 
chicken was baked, you may slice it thinly and sauté the slices in a skillet 
in coconut oil or olive oil, to get some crispy edges. You don't have to do 
this step since the chicken is already cooked, but the crispy edges 
somewhat mimic traditional shawarma shaved off the spit. I also like to 
sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt, too. 
4.Slice thinly and serve with your desired accompaniments like lavash, 
lettuce, tomato, pickled vegetables, onion, olives 
⅔ cup plain whole Greek yogurt 
½ cup good-quality mayonnaise  
3 garlic cloves, minced 
1 tbsp freshly squeezed 
lemon juice 
⅛ tsp sea salt 
⅛ tsp paprika 
Freshly ground black pepper 
5.Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl, adding black pepper to taste. 
Refrigerate until ready to serve. Can be made 1 day in advance. Stir 
before serving.

Greek Chicken with Cucumber-Feta Salad 
Time: 30 minutes | New York Times 
1½ cups plain Greek yogurt 
3 garlic cloves, finely grated 
Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) 
Black pepper 
1 tsp dried oregano or mint 
2 lb boneless, skinless chicken 
thighs, patted dry 
1½ lb Persian cucumbers 
1 lb ripe tomatoes 
2 tbsps extra-virgin olive oil 
4 oz feta, crumbled (about ¾ cup) 
½ cup Kalamata olives, pitted and 
halved 
1.In a large bowl, stir together the yogurt and garlic; season to taste with 
salt and pepper. Transfer ½ cup of the yogurt to a medium bowl and 
reserve for Step 5. 
2.Coat the chicken: To the large bowl, add the oregano and stir to 
combine. Season the chicken all over with 1½ tsps salt and a few grinds 
of pepper. Add the chicken to the large bowl and turn to coat; set aside. 
3.Start the salad: Smash the cucumbers with the side of your knife until 
craggy and split. Rip into ½- to 1-inch pieces and transfer to a colander 
placed in the sink. Slice or chop the tomatoes into bite-size pieces. Add 
to the cucumbers along with 1 ½ tsps salt. (It may seem like a lot of salt, 
but most will drain away.) Toss to combine and leave to drain. 
4.In a large nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet, heat the olive oil over 
medium. Scrape excess marinade off the chicken, then cook the chicken 
in batches, adding oil to the pan if necessary, until it’s well browned and 
releases from the pan, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip and cook until cooked 
through, another 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to plates to rest.  
a.To grill the chicken: Heat a grill to medium and clean and grease 
the grates. Grill the chicken over direct heat until it's well browned 
and releases from the grates, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip and cook until 
cooked through, another 5 to 7 minutes. (For a gas grill, close the 
lid between flips.)

Tonkatsu 
1 hour | NY Times 
For the tonkatsu sauce: 
⅓ cup ketchup 
¼ cup plus 1 tbsp Worcestershire 
sauce 
2 tbsps granulated sugar 
1 tbsp oyster sauce 
For the cabbage: 
4 tbsps Kewpie mayonnaise 
2 tbsps rice vinegar 
1 tbsps soy sauce 
1 tsp toasted sesame oil 
3 cups shredded green cabbage 
For the tonkasu: 
9 (usually 3 per package) boneless 
pork loin chops, trimmed of excess fat 
Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) 
Black pepper 
1 tbsp vegetable oil, plus more for 
frying (about 7 cups) 
1 cup all-purpose flour 
3 large eggs 
1 box panko 
Steamed rice, for serving 
1.Make the tonkatsu sauce and dressing: In a small bowl, combine the 
ketchup, Worcestershire, sugar and oyster sauce. In another small bowl, 
whisk the mayonnaise, rice vinegar, soy sauce and sesame oil. Taste and 
adjust seasonings, if needed. 
2.Prepare the tonkatsu: Using a sharp knife, make shallow slits on the pork loin, 
along the connective tissue, the white thick strip between the fat and the 
meat. Flip the pork and repeat on the other side. Using a meat mallet, lbs the 
pork until it’s ¼-inch thick. Lightly season the pork with salt and pepper, 
being mindful that the tonkatsu sauce is well seasoned. 
3.In a deep, heavy-bottomed pot, add 2 inches of oil. Heat over medium-high 
until the temperature reaches 350 degrees. Heat the oven to 200 degrees. 
Place a wire rack on a sheet pan for the fried pork. (If desired, line the sheet 
pan with parchment for easier cleanup.) 
4.Place the flour on a plate. In a shallow dish, like a pie plate, whisk the eggs 
and 1 tbsp of oil until combined. To a similar size dish, add the panko. Place 
a second sheet pan or a large plate nearby for the coated pork. 
5.Coat each piece of pork in the flour, shaking off any excess. Dip in the egg 
mixture, allowing any excess to drip back into the dish. Finally, coat in the 
48

panko, gently pressing down to make sure it sticks to the pork. Place on the 
sheet pan and set aside for 10 minutes at room temperature to allow the 
crust to adhere to the meat. 
6.When the oil is at temperature, transfer the pork loins, one at a time to avoid 
overcrowding, to the hot oil. Fry for 1 minute, turn pork and fry the other side 
for 1 minute. Using tongs, remove the pork from the oil, holding it over the 
pot to allow any excess oil to drip off. Place on the wire rack and let it rest for 
4 minutes. While the first pork loin rests, fry the second loin. After the 4 
minute rest, return the first pork loin to the pot and fry for a second time, 
until golden brown, about 30 seconds per side. Lift the pork out, as before, 
and hold it on its side over the pot to allow any excess oil to drip off. (If you’d 
like, transfer to a separate wire rack on a sheet pan in a warm oven.) Repeat 
frying and resting with the remaining pork loins. In between each fry, use a 
mesh sieve or slotted spoon to skim off and discard any crumbs floating in 
the oil, and adjust the heat as necessary to maintain the temperature. 
7.Slice the pork into ¾-inch-thick strips and drizzle with the tonkatsu sauce. 
Serve alongside rice, and the shredded cabbage drizzled with the dressing, if 
you’d like.

1.To prepare the barbecue sauce, place the brown sugar, ketchup, apple 
cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger in a 
medium saucepan. Simmer over medium-low heat for 10 minutes. 
Refrigerate until ready to use. 
2.Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 300°F. 
3.To prepare the onions, spread the olive oil evenly in a 12-inch cast iron 
skillet over medium heat, add the onions, and cook, stirring 
occasionally, until golden. Remove rom the pan and set aside. 
4.Turn up the heat to medium, add the brisket, and cook, turning once, 
until seared on both sides, about 5 minutes. You may need to add a 
bit more olive oil to keep the meat from sticking to the pan. 
5.Remove from the heat and spread the barbecue sauce evenly over the 
top of the meat. Sprinkle the cooked onions over the brisket, cover the 
skillet tightly with foil, and bake until fork-tender, about 3 hours. To 
serve, cut crosswise into ½-inch slices.
