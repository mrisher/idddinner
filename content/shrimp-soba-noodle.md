Like [Beef Yakisoba](https://allwaysdelicious.com/yakisoba/), this Shrimp Yakisoba combines tender Japanese wheat noodles with protein and veggies. In this case, shrimp, cabbage, thin slices of onion, mushrooms, and carrots are tangled up with the nooodles.

A sweet-savory sauce made of oyster sauce, [hoisin sauce](https://amzn.to/3rNA4v4), and other ingredients finishes off the Shrimp Yakisoba recipe.

If you love [Beef Yakisoba](https://allwaysdelicious.com/yakisoba/), this Shrimp Yakisoba is a nice change of pace. It has all the same great flavors, but is a bit lighter and lets the veggies really shine.

**WHAT INGREDIENTS DO YOU NEED?**
---------------------------------

Shrimp Yakisoba is a great weeknight dish because it requires just a few basic ingredients. If you don’t have the exact ingredients listed, you can substitute what you do have. This stir fried noodles recipe is super flexible.

*   **Cooking oil**—You can use any high smoke point, neutral flavored oil. I like peanut oil, avocado oil, grapeseed oil, safflower oil, canola oil, etc.
*   **Shrimp**—Save yourself time and effort and buy shrimp that is already peeled and deveined.
*   **Noodles**—[Yakisoba noodles](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yakisoba%20noodles&i=grocery&crid=SBRBTCSV74Z1&sprefix=yakisoba%20noodles%2Cgrocery%2C128&linkCode=sl2&tag=twola-20&linkId=6a9bf1ec3429a8974acb33311998c202&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) are different from soba noodles (the ones made from buckwheat and usually served cold). They are more similar to [ramen](https://allwaysdelicious.com/ramen-for-beginners-2/) noodles. [Yakisoba noodles](https://amzn.to/3rP9UIw) are made from wheat flour with _kansui_ (an alkalinizing agent), which gives them a springy texture and yellowish tint. Use dry yakisoba noodles or [chuka soba](https://amzn.to/3MuVBki) noodles or fresh or frozen yakisoba noodles. You can substitute udon noodles or even spaghetti noodles, but the texture will of course be different.
*   **Vegetables**—Use a mixture of cabbage, carrots, mushrooms, and onions—or substitute what you have on hand. For instance, try adding sliced bell pepper, bean sprouts, or broccoli, if you have them.
*   **Homemade yakisoba sauce**—The Shrimp Yakisoba Sauce easy to whip up using soy sauce, [Worcestershire sauce](https://www.amazon.com/Bull-Dog-Worcestershire-Sauce-10-1-Fl/dp/B0002IZD0W?crid=3TGZ5GMKQKN31&keywords=Worcestershire+sauce+japanese&qid=1659562836&sprefix=worcestershire+sauce+japanese%2Caps%2C146&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=twola-20&linkId=32c18dddef1c970403c338557e2ebcb5&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, [chile paste](https://amzn.to/3LfWFbt), and sugar. Try adding a splash of [sesame oil](https://www.amazon.com/Kadoya-Pure-Sesame-Fluid-Ounce/dp/B002HMN6SC?asc_contentid=amzn1.osa.9a9e163e-f46b-46dd-b99d-45b36eeb3c2b.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&asc_contenttype=article&ascsubtag=amzn1.osa.9a9e163e-f46b-46dd-b99d-45b36eeb3c2b.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&content-id=amzn1.sym.01243ef6-1f4d-40e2-ad34-d02b1375dcf1%3Aamzn1.sym.01243ef6-1f4d-40e2-ad34-d02b1375dcf1&crid=E6RO0PMOW7UU&cv_ct_cx=sesame+oil&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osa.9a9e163e-f46b-46dd-b99d-45b36eeb3c2b.ATVPDKIKX0DER.en_US&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_we=asin&cv_ct_wn=osp-single-source-pecos-desktop&keywords=sesame+oil&pd_rd_i=B002HMN6SC&pd_rd_r=ee11ea37-a6d4-4e72-be25-ddbc685326a2&pd_rd_w=6aEVv&pd_rd_wg=sfbbp&pf_rd_p=01243ef6-1f4d-40e2-ad34-d02b1375dcf1&pf_rd_r=SG3CWB4MZ9JSGCMDYAX2&qid=1670100112&sprefix=sesame+oil%2Caps%2C159&sr=1-1-c26ac7f6-b43f-4741-a772-17cad7536576&linkCode=ll1&tag=twola-20&linkId=4003006436aca04ca80dfcd3eb57c334&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) if you like. If you don't want to make your own [yakisoba sauce](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OE36IPA?tag=twola-20), you can purchase it in an Asian supermarket or online.
*   **Garnish**—You can top your Shrimp Yakisoba with sliced green onions or toasted sesame seeds.

#### For the noodles

*   ▢ 3 tablespoons cooking oil divided
*   ▢ 1 pound peeled and deveined shrimp
*   ▢ 8 ounces dried yakisoba or chuka soba noodles or 16 ounces fresh or frozen yakisoba noodles
*   ▢ ½ small onion sliced
*   ▢ 1 carrot peeled and cut into matchsticks
*   ▢ 6 shiitake mushrooms stemmed and sliced
*   ▢ ¼ green cabbage thinly sliced
*   ▢ 2 green onions sliced

#### For the sauce

*   ▢ 2 tablespoons soy sauce
*   ▢ 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
*   ▢ 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
*   ▢ 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
*   ▢ 1 teaspoons chile paste
*   ▢ 1 ½ teaspoons sugar

*   Cook the noodles al dente in a pot of boiling water—about 2 minutes for dried chuka soba noodles or 1 minute for fresh noodles. Drain in a colander and rinse with cool water to stop the  
    cooking. Leave in a colander in the sink to drain while you continue with the recipe.
    
*   In a bowl whisk together the soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, chile paste, and sugar.

    to a plate or bowl.
    
*   Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet along with the onion, carrot, and mushrooms. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.
    
*   Add the cabbage and green onions and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute, until the cabbage begins to wilt. Add the shrimp and noodles and cook, stirring to mix well, for about 2 minutes more until everything is warmed through and the cabbage is beginning to wilt.
    
*   Add the sauce and cook, tossing to coat the noodles well with the sauce and mix everything together, for about 2 more minutes.
    
*   Serve hot.

noodles or fresh or frozen yakisoba noodles.
