11/27/25

cream , sour cream, feta, butter – was amazing. Salted potato water. Added chives at the end. Don’t under or over cook potatoes (use salted water), remember to fold in the stuff at the end, not rice it in.

11/23/23

Added sour cream, feta, some triple cream cheese, some butter, some mustard, some honey mustard

Was too all over the place, not great – honey mustard was blah. Needed pepper.

9/10/23

1.2 lbs russet

Salted water, added cream, sour cream, feta, some butter

(was so good)

Remember to fold cheese in, not use the ricer

11/26/22

3.5 lbs potatoes

Salted water, added milk, sour cream, pecorino, triple cheese (was so good)

Overall, was ok – needed umami of some kind. Next time suggest some garlic powder? Mustard? cayenne?

3.0 lbs potatoes

6 tbs butter

1 cup milk

4 oz sour cream

4 oz goat cheese

2 oz pecorino

Russet potatoes great, left out butter. Salted water. Needs a little kick of something, suggest some mustard?

5/31 -- Not creamy, potatoes just slightly undercooked which was trouble -- original recipe had milk and more butter, maybe the type of cheese matters?

Potatoes (2.5 lbs)

*   1 cups (475ml) whole milk
*   6 tablespoons unsalted butter room temperature, cut into 1/2-inch pats

Alternatively to milk/butter

Sour Cream (8 oz)

Sheep’s Milk Cheese (Pecorino Romano, 2 oz)

Other Soft Cheese (whatever if you got it)

Unsalted Butter (2 tbsp)

1.  Peel potatoes and cut into rough chunks, about 1 to 2 inches cubed. Transfer to a bowl of cold water to rinse. Change water 2 or 3 times until it runs clear.
2.  In a Dutch oven or large stockpot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil over high heat. Add potatoes and cook until completely tender, about 15 minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander and rinse under hot running water for 30 seconds to wash away excess starch. Set a ricer or food mill over now-empty pot and pass potatoes through.
3.  Add sour cream, butter, cheeses and fold gently with a rubber spatula to combine.
4.  Season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep warm until ready to serve.
