In this vegetarian main inspired by Indian dal, lentils are cooked with an aromatic blend of Thai spices — fresh ginger, turmeric, red curry paste and chile — then simmered in coconut milk until fall-apart tender. Browning the sweet potatoes before cooking them with the lentils brings out their sweetness, balancing the heat from the chile and curry paste, while baby spinach tossed in just before serving adds fresh flavor. Serve over steamed white or brown rice, or with toasted flatbread on the side.

1.  Step
    
    1
    
    In a Dutch oven or pot, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high. Add the sweet potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned all over, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer the browned sweet potatoes to a plate and set aside.
    
2.  Step
    
    2
    
    Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pot and set the heat to medium-low. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the curry paste, garlic, ginger, chile and turmeric, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
    
3.  Step
    
    3
    
    Add the lentils, stock, salt and browned sweet potatoes to the pot and bring to a boil over high. Lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the lentils are just tender, 20 to 25 minutes.
    
4.  Step
    
    4
    
    Add the coconut milk and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has reduced and the lentils are creamy and falling apart, 15 to 20 minutes.
    
5.  Step
    
    5
    
    Add the spinach and stir until just wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Off the heat, stir in the lime juice and season with salt to taste.

To those of you who are fat phobic. Why buy lite coconut milk? You are simply paying for the extra water that was added to make it "lite". Buy whole coconut milk, dilute it with water to your taste and freeze the remaining milk for another use. It does freeze beautifully.

@patricia Curry powder- Indian Curry paste- Thai Totally different flavors

I made this in an instant pot. Browned the sweet potatoes in the IP using the sauté function, then cooked the onions in there too. Cooked the lentils and potatoes on high pressure for 12 minutes. Came out perfect.

This recipe is phenomenal. The crispy sweet potatoes add such depth and pair beautifully with the coconut milk.

I would reduce the broth amount by half. Should have trusted my gut! Taste is great.

Fantastic recipe with tons of flavor! Will be in my regular rotation!
