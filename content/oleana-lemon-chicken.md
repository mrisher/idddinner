### INGREDIENTS

*   1/3 cup chopped preserved lemon
*   3/4 stick butter at room temperature
*   4 1/2 pounds of chicken, skin on, but de-boned (we used thighs and breasts)
*   8 tablespoons Z'atar
*   kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

### INSTRUCTIONS

*   In a small bowl, mash the butter and preserved lemon together to make a lemon-butter.
*   Season the chicken pieces on all sides with salt and pepper. Create pockets under the skin of each piece of chicken with your fingers. make the pockets go as deep as you can without piercing all the way through to the other side.
*   Divide the lemon-butter among the pieces of chicken, distributing it evenly under the skin of each piece.
*   Heat a large skillet over high heat, and place a little butter and EVOO in to melt. When the butter begins to brown, place the chicken skin side down into the pan. be careful not to overcrowd the pan (you will need to cook the chicken in 2 batches or 2 pans). Place the foil wrapped skillet on top of the chicken and press into place. Reduce the heat to medium-high and cook until the chicken is brown and crispy on one side, about 8 minutes. Remove the top pan and turn the chicken over. Add a little more butter to the pan and then place the covered skillet back over the chicken. Cook for another 8-10 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
*   Remove the chicken from the pan and place on a large platter, sprinkle liberally with the Z'atar and serve.
