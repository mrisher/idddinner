These spice-loaded meatballs have a Turkish inflection. The warm yogurt sauce adds tang and richness, along with a sprinkling of tart sumac powder and chopped mint. American "Greek-style" yogurt is not always tart enough, but it can be thinned with a bit of buttermilk or even lemon juice. Whisking it with cornstarch and egg produces a silky sauce. Though the ingredient list looks long, this is a simple and impressive dish to make.

1.  Step
    
    1
    
    In a large bowl, use your hands to combine lamb, breadcrumbs, salt, pepper, onion, cumin, coriander, cinnamon and cayenne. Beat 2 of the eggs and add to meat, mixing until incorporated. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 24 hours to allow the seasonings to permeate the meat.
    
2.  Step
    
    2
    
    Using wet hands, break off walnut-sized pieces of lamb mixture, roll into spheres and set aside on a baking sheet. You should have about 30 1-ounce meatballs.
    
3.  Step
    
    3
    
    Heat oven to 225 degrees. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. When shimmering, add meatballs in one layer and brown for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn and cook for 4 to 5 minutes more. (Work in batches, if necessary, to avoid crowding the pan.) Transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to blot any extra oil, then pile meatballs on a heatproof serving platter and keep warm in the oven.
    
4.  Step
    
    4
    
    Pour off any excess oil from skillet and turn heat to high. Add broth and bring to a simmer. In a bowl, whisk together yogurt; ½ teaspoon salt; remaining egg, beaten; and cornstarch. Pour yogurt mixture in a thin stream into the hot broth, whisking constantly. Turn heat down slightly and continue whisking until yogurt is heated through and slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Do not let mixture boil.
    
5.  Step
    
    5
    
    Pour hot yogurt sauce over meatballs. Sprinkle crumbled feta, sumac and crushed red pepper on top. Finish with pinches of turmeric, if using, and sprinkle with mint, dill and cilantro. Serve immediately with rice, orzo, pita bread or potatoes.

while very nice, if you had added a bunch of chopped parsley, the mint, and plenty of dill to the meatballs themselves, they would be, and are moister, and more flavorful. and really no need for a yogurt sauce. yogurt will do, and is much more turkish. ayse

I made this again tonight and was thrilled with the outcome. It takes a little elbow grease, but is worth it. I used a potato masher to mix the meat and spices and then used a cookie scoop for the meatballs. Not looking to start some big debate about my methods...but those two steps help make this a little quicker for me. Also, I just bake the meatballs in the oven at 400 for 20 mins and skip the pan fry.

Put the dill and mint in the meatballs as per other comments and that was awesome! Added one lemon juiced to Fage 2% and that was perfect tartness. Delicious recipe!

For folks that don't like the taste of yogurt, is there another sauce to use - maybe one with tahini?

I took the advice and incorporated the mint and dill in the meatball, and cooked them in the oven at 400 (no pan fry). The yogurt sauce is good, but not great and so, for me not worth the effort. Next time, I will just mix some greek yogurt with feta cheese, some lemon and sumac or za'tar.

This was lovely! I added dill and mint to the meatballs as others suggested, and since I had them, used some crushed Urfa chile at the end in lieu of crushed hot red pepper. Loved the herbs, turmeric, and sumac. So flavorful. Felt very spring like. I served it with orzo, the NYT Taverna salad and an olive oil cake for dessert. 100% NYT menu. Dinner for 5 and it was a hit.
