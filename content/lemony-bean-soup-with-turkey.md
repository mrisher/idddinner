Bright with lemon and herbs, and packed with hearty greens, this highly adaptable soup can be either light and brothy or thick and stewlike, depending on your preference. Smashing some of the beans to release their starch will give you a thicker soup that’s almost worthy of a fork. To keep it on the brothy side, add a little more liquid and leave the beans intact. Either way, it’s a warming, piquant, one-pot meal that’s perfect for winter.

1.  Step
    
    1
    
    Heat a large pot over medium-high for a minute or so to warm it up. Add the oil and heat until it thins out, about 30 seconds. Add onion and carrot, and sauté until very soft and brown at the edges, 7 to 10 minutes.
    
2.  Step
    
    2
    
    Meanwhile, rinse the greens and pull the leaves off the stems. Tear or chop into bite-size pieces and set aside.
    
3.  Step
    
    3
    
    When the onion is golden, add tomato paste, ¾ teaspoon cumin and ⅛ teaspoon red-pepper flakes to the pot, and sauté until paste darkens, about 1 minute. Add turkey, garlic, ginger and 1 teaspoon salt, and sauté, breaking up the meat with your spoon, until turkey is browned in spots, 4 to 7 minutes.
    
4.  Step
    
    4
    
    Add stock and beans, and bring to a simmer. Let simmer until the soup is thick and flavorful, adding more salt if needed, 15 to 25 minutes. If you like a thicker broth, you can smash some of the beans with the back of the spoon to release their starch. Or leave the beans whole for a brothier soup.
    
5.  Step
    
    5
    
    Add the greens to the pot and simmer until they are very soft. This will take 5 to 10 minutes for most greens, but tough collard greens might take 15 minutes. (Add a little water if the broth gets too reduced.)
    
6.  Step
    
    6
    
    Stir herbs and lemon juice into the pot, taste and add more salt, cumin and lemon until the broth is lively and bright-tasting. Serve topped with a drizzle of olive oil and more red-pepper flakes, if desired.

You never need to be without that pesky "1 Tbsp. of tomato paste." Open a can at both ends and remove the lid from one end. Using the other lid, push out approximately a tablespoonful of paste, slice it off and lay it on a sheet of waxed paper on a small cutting board or flat tray; repeat until you've used it all. Place the rounds of paste in the freezer and, when frozen solid, store in a zipper bag with the air sucked out. Voila, small portions of tomato paste on demand.

I'm always confused by "bunch of greens." One store near me sells a bundle of kale that will feed 2 or 3 people when cooked, while another store sells bunches large enough to feed 5 or 6. It would be clearer if recipes used a different measuring system, like how many leaves or cups of chopped greens.

I don’t throw away the tasty stalks of the greens, whether those be kale, collard or what ever I might have on hand. Instead, after stripping the leaves, I dice the stalks into 1/4” bits and sauté them with the onion. The extra cooking time renders them soft and they add to the overall flavor of the dish.

Delicious, easy and inexpensive with nearly all pantry ingredients. Made as directed except instead of greens let my family put baby spinach in their soup bowls and ladle hot soup over it, which is good for picky palates. I was a little skeptical about the flavor combinations but it really was delicious. I was heavy handed with the ginger and used parsley and used a pound of turkey since that was the smallest size at the grocery store. Perfect for a cold day.

I followed the recipe, using tarragon as the herb and a full head of kale (sans big vein, leaves cut into tiny short strips) and mashed some of the white beans. At the end I added a bit of smoked paprika, an extra can of chickpeas and a a few cups of cooked blended brown and black rice to create a complete protein and additional fiber. It has been a SMASH! What a great twist on this chili like dish.

I added lemon zest to amp up the lemon flavor. The beans might retain better texture if added later in the process.
