**Roasted Tomato Basil Soup**

Serves 4

10 tomatoes, halved/quartered lengthwise depending on the size

4 Tb fresh basil

4 cloves garlic, minced

5 Tb olive oil

4 shallots, halved

1 ½- 2 cups dry white wine

Preheat the oven to 400°F. Arrange the tomatoes with the cut side up on a large roasting pan. Sprinkle 1 Tb of fresh basil and the garlic evenly over the tomatoes. Drizzle with olive oil evenly over the tomatoes. Roast the tomatoes until they are soft when pierced with a fork and the skins slip off easily (~40 mins). Remove from the oven and let the tomatoes cool slightly until you can safely remove the skins, saving the tomatoes and any juices (I squeeze the skins to release any remaining juices before discarding).

In a large pot over medium-high heat, warm 1 Tb olive oil and once hot, add the shallots. Sauté the shallots until they are translucent. Add the roasted tomatoes, garlic, wine, and ½ cup chicken broth (I taste before adding the broth and sometimes leave it out- all depends on the flavor of the tomatoes!) and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered until the tomatoes have broken down and the soup has thickened (~20 minutes). Season to taste with salt and pepper. Depending on the sweetness of the tomatoes, I sometimes add a little sugar- just about 2tsp- 1Tb.

Puree the soup with an immersion blender. Serve with remaining fresh basil.
