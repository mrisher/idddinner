Tips for the Garlic Butter Chicken Recipe
-----------------------------------------

This c**hicken and cauliflower recipe** is full of rich, buttery herb flavors with both chicken and cauliflower rice all cooked in one pan for quick, easy prep and final cleanup. This [healthy chicken breast recipe](https://www.eatwell101.com/healthy-chicken-breast-recipes) is low in carbs, gluten-free, and Keto diet-friendly. Here are a few tips so you can make the most of this delicious chicken and cauliflower dinner recipe:

*   Make sure to use a good quality non-stick pan. Otherwise, the parmesan might end up sticking to the pan and not on the chicken. If this occurs, deglaze the pan with a little chicken broth before adding the cauliflower rice.
*   Cooking time will depend on the thickness of your chicken cutlets. If using whole chicken breasts, the **chicken and cauliflower rice recipe** will take about 10 to 15 minutes more.
*   Don’t skimp on spices and lemon; they really help to cut through the bland flavor of cauliflower and bring life to the whole dish.
*   You can enrich the sauce by adding some white wine when you deglaze the pan.

Directions
----------

**The  Garlic  Butter Chicken**

**1.** In a shallow plate, combine parmesan cheese, grated garlic, paprika, and Italian seasoning. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper; dredge in the parmesan mixture; shake off excess and set aside.

**2.** In a large non-stick skillet melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat. Cook chicken cutlets until golden on each side and cooked through – about 3-4 minutes for each side, depending on the thickness of your chicken cutlets. Transfer to a plate.

**The Parmesan Cauliflower Rice**

**1.** In the same pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Fry the garlic and onion for 1 minute until fragrant — be careful not to burn.

**2.** Add the **riced cauliflower** to the skillet and stir to mix everything together well and coat in melted butter. Cook, stirring regularly for 1 minute.

**3.** Stir in the 2 tablespoons vegetable stock, about half the parsley, and lemon zest (if using). Cook the cauliflower rice for one minute to reduce juices then add the lemon juice and a few sprinkles of leftover parmesan cheese, if you like.

**4.** Adjust seasoning as needed. Stir in the remaining parsley. Return chicken breasts over **cauliflower rice** and reheat quickly. Serve your parmesan chicken with fresh cracked black pepper, red chili pepper flakes, and more parmesan. Enjoy!

**Note:** Make sure to use a non-stick pan, otherwise the parmesan might stick.
