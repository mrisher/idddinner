Carla Lalli Music, a food writer and editor, is vehemently opposed to roasting sweet potatoes. “I don’t understand why people are constantly roasting them,” she says. “Roasting just makes them more fibrous and leathery, and they never, ever really get crispy.” Instead, she posits that steaming performs a kind of alchemy on sweet potatoes that roasting never does — the moist heat fluffs them into absorbent clouds. And to make up for the inherent blandness of the cooking method, she slathers them with a rich tahini butter spiked with soy sauce, which immediately melts into a mouth-smacking sauce. Her simple recipe ends with a shower of golden sesame seeds and a torrent of lime juice. Try it — every bite will surprise you with crunch, salt, umami and acidity to counterbalance the sweetness of the pillowy potatoes. —Samin Nosrat

1.  Step
    
    1
    
    Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a medium pot fitted with a steamer basket or footed colander. Place sweet potatoes in the steamer. Cover, reduce heat to medium and steam until potatoes are completely tender, 35 to 40 minutes. (Use a skewer or paring knife to check for doneness; the potatoes should be soft all the way through.)
    
2.  Step
    
    2
    
    Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk butter, tahini, lime juice, soy sauce, sesame oil and garlic until smooth. It might seem as if the butter and liquids will never fully combine, but they will — just keep stirring! Taste, and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper and more lime juice as needed.
    
3.  Step
    
    3
    
    Set a small pan over medium heat. Toast the sesame seeds, swirling the pan continuously, until seeds are golden. They’ll give off some oil and start to clump together, so if needed, stir with a wooden spoon to keep them moving so that they toast evenly. They’ll turn a nice deep-golden shade just as they dry off a bit, about 4 minutes. Transfer seeds to a small bowl to prevent them from overcooking.
    
4.  Step
    
    4
    
    When the sweet potatoes are tender, use tongs to transfer them to a large plate or platter. When they are just cool enough to handle, split potatoes in half lengthwise, and season with flaky salt. Spread tahini butter generously onto the flesh, and top with sesame seeds. Serve immediately with lime wedges.

OK I try not to weigh in often but as a physician who has recently lost over 25 pounds, can I say that a vegetable 'fat bomb' of this nature fits in beautifully with starch and fat cravings while contributing vitamins and fiber that are so much better than any processed foods? Eating this recipe weekly is part of the secret to my success!

We frequently eat baked sweet potatoes that are wrapped in foil paper. This time I baked one in the oven in foil paper and steamed one. The steamed one was tasted bland; the baked one was deliciously sweet. The tahini butter was a nice touch, but was unnecessary with the baked one. I'll stay with baking.

This is one of the BEST recipes I've come across on here. It's delicious. I've made it several times in the past few weeks at the request of friends and family. And I've been asked to share the recipe several times as well. Delicious with Japanese yams, and works great if subbing tamari for soy, too. Definitely a winner! Full disclosure: I cooked my sweet potatoes in the microwave, because I'm often short on time and also I'm a complete heathen.

The tahini sauce is good enough to want to eat with a spoon! But I just don't love sweet potatoes. I'll definitely try the sauce on other veggies, though. Maybe fish, too. Or there's that spoon, too...

Accidentally over softened the butter today - it mixed so easily! And I just popped the whole thing in the fridge to get it back to a more solid . I always make a double batch of this tahini butter because it goes on everything especially dark greens. And keeps beautifully in the fridge.

Meh, this probably won't be a repeat for me. I love all the constituent ingredients, I just wasn't wowed. For starters, I think the texture of the sweet potato skin is far worse when steamed rather than baked -- soft and kind of rubbery rather than caramelized. And while tahini, butter, lime and soy sauce taste good together (kind of a peanut sauce variation), I feel like there are better things to eat with a sweet potato (honestly just good quality butter and a sprinkle of salt is my favorite).
