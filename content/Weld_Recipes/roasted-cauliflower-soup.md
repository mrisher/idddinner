Roasted cauliflower soup 
 
Ingredients 
1 large head cauliflower (about 2 pounds), cut into bite-size flo rets 
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided 
Fine sea salt 
1 medium red onion, chopped 
2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced 
4 cups (32 ounces) vegetable broth 
2 tablespoons unsalted butter 
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, or more if needed 
Scant ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg 
For garnish: 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh fla t-leaf parsley, chives and/or green 
onions 
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. If desired, line a large, rimmed baking 
sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup. 
On the baking sheet, toss the cauliflower with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil until lightly 
and evenly coated in oil. Arrange the cauliflo wer in a single layer and sprinkle lightly with 
salt. Bake until the cauliflower is tender and caramelized on the edges, 25 to 35 
minutes, tossing halfway. 

Once the cauliflower is almost done, in a Dutch oven or soup pot, warm the remaining 1 
tablespoon olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion and ¼ teaspoon 
salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened and turning translucent, 5 to 
7 minutes. 
Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds, then add 
the broth. 
Reserve 4 of the prettiest roasted cauliflower florets for garnish. Then transfer the 
remaining cauliflower to the pot. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring the mixture 
to a simmer, then reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, 
stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, to give the fla vors time to meld. 
Once the soup is done cooking, remove the pot from the heat and let it cool for a few 
minutes. Then, carefully transfer the hot soup to a blender, working in batches if 
necessary. (Do not fill past the maximum fil l line or the soup could overflow!) 
Add the butter and blend until smooth. Add the lemon juice and nutmeg and blend again. 
Add additional salt, to taste (I usually add another ¼ to ¾ teaspoon, depending on the 
broth). This soup tastes amazing once it’s properly salted! You can also a little more 
lemon juice, if it needs more zing. Blend again. 
Top individual bowls of soup with 1 roasted cauliflo wer floret and a sprinkle of chopped 
parsley, green onion and/or chives. This soup keeps well in the refrigerator, covered, for 
about four days, or for several months in the freezer.
