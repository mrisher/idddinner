Marcella Hazan tomato sauce 
 
(actually takes like an hour, but a very low maintenance hour, mainly simmering; really good with 
homemade pasta) 
 
2 cups tomatoes, in addition to their juices (for example, a 28-ounce can of San Marzano whole 
peeled tomatoes) 
5 tablespoons butter 
1 onion, peeled and cut only in half 
Salt 
 
1. Combine the tomatoes, their juices, the butter and the onion halves in a 
saucepan. Add a pinch or two of salt. 
2. Place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Cook, uncovered, for about 45 
minutes. Stir occasionally, mashing any large pieces of tomato with a spoon.Add 
salt as needed. 
3. Discard the onion (some people may want to eat them separately).  David likes to 
use a hand blender to homogenize the sauce at this point.  This recipe makes 
enough sauce for a pound of pasta.
