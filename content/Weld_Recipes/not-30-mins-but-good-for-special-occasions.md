Prep Time: 2 hours, 10 minutes 
 Cook Time: 25 minutes 
Total Time: 3 hours 
Yield: 8 bagels 
Make fresh bagels right at home with this tested dough recipe. Don’t skip the water bath 
and egg wash—both provide an extra chewy and golden brown crust.  
Ingredients 
1 and 1/2 cups (360g/ml) warm water (between 100–110°F/38–43°C) 
1 Tablespoon barley malt syrup, granulated sugar, or brown sugar* 
2 and 3/4 teaspoons (8g) instant or active dry yeast* 
4 cups (520g) bread flour (spooned & leveled), plus more as needed* 
2 teaspoons salt 
for coating the bowl: nonstick spray or 2 teaspoons butter or olive oil 
For Boiling & Topping 
2 quarts (1.9L) water 

1/4 cup (85g) barley malt syrup or honey 
egg wash: 1 egg white beaten with 1 Tablespoon water 
Instructions 
Prepare the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, 
whisk the warm water, barley malt syrup/sugar, and yeast together. Cover and allow to sit 
for 5 minutes. *If you don’t have a stand mixer, use a large mixing bowl and mix the 
dough with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula in the next step.* 
Add the flour and salt, and beat on medium speed for 2 minutes, until the dough comes 
together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. If it seems too sticky and clings to 
the sides of the bowl instead of forming a rough mass around the dough hook or spoon, 
add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue to mix until the dough pulls away 
from the sides of the bowl. The dough should be stiff and somewhat dry. If it is crumbly 
and breaks off in pieces, add more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, mixing well after each 
addition.
 
Knead the dough: When the dough has reached the proper consistency, beat on low 
speed with the dough hook for an additional 6–7 minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly 
floured surface for 6–7 minutes, until the dough feels smooth, supple, and elastic. (If 
you’re new to bread-making, my How to Knead Dough video tutorial can help here.) If the 
dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flo ur at a 
time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky 
dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After 
kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly 
bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a “windowpane test” to see 
if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off a small (roughly golfball-size) piece 
of dough and gently stretch it out until it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it 
up to a window or light. Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough 

tearing first? If so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If 
not, keep kneading until it passes the windowpane test. 
Lightly grease a large bowl with nonstick spray, butter, or oil. Place the dough in the bowl, 
turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen 
towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 1.5–2 hours, or until doubled in 
size. 
Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. 
Shape the bagels: When the dough is risen, punch it down to release the air. On a lightly 
floured surface, divide the dough into 8 equal pieces, about 4 ounces (113g) each. 
Shape each piece into a ball. Press your index fin ger through the center of each ball to 
make a hole about 1.5–2 inches in diameter. Arrange the shaped bagels on the prepared 
baking sheets. Loosely cover the shaped bagels with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and 
let them rest for 5–10 minutes as you prepare the water bath. 
Preheat the oven to 425°F (218°C). 
Water bath: Fill a large, wide pot with 2 quarts (1.9L) of water. Whisk in the barley malt 
syrup or honey. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-high. Drop 2 
or 3 bagels in at a time, making sure they have enough room to flo at around. Boil the 
bagels for 1 minute, then use a spatula to flip each bagel over and boil for 1 minute 
more. Using a slotted metal spatula, lift the bagels out of the water, letting the excess 
water drain off. Place the bagels back on the lined baking sheets. Repeat with remaining 
bagels. 
Using a pastry brush, brush the egg wash on top and around the sides of each bagel. If 
you’re adding toppings, dip the tops of the bagels into the toppings immediately after 
applying the egg wash. 

Bake for 20–25 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through, until the bagels are dark 
golden brown. Allow the bagels to cool on the baking sheets for 20 minutes, then 
transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely. 
Slice, toast, top, whatever you want! Cover leftover bagels tightly and store at room 
temperature for up to 4 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
