3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
1large onion, thinly sliced 
1large red bell pepper, thinly sliced 
3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced 
1 teaspoon ground cumin 
1 teaspoon sweet paprika 
⅛ teaspoon ground cayenne, or to taste 
1 (28-ounce) can whole plum tomatoes with

1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-low. Add onion and bell 
pepper. Cook gently until very soft, about 20 minutes. You can optionally add a can of 
chickpeas here. Add garlic and cook until tender, 1 to 2 minutes; stir in cumin, paprika 
and cayenne, and cook 1 minute. Pour in tomatoes and season with ¾ teaspoon salt and 
¼ teaspoon pepper; simmer until tomatoes have thickened, about 10 minutes. Taste and 
add more salt and pepper if needed. Stir in crumbled feta. 
2. Gently crack eggs into skillet over tomatoes. Season eggs with salt and pepper. Transfer 
skillet to oven and bake until eggs are just set with runny yolks, 7 to 10 minutes.  
Sprinkle with cilantro and serve with hot sauce and pitas for dipping.
