Apple sharlotka 
 
Butter or nonstick spray, for greasing pan 
6 large, tart apples, such as Granny Smiths 
3 large eggs 
1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
1 cup (125 grams) all-purpose flour 
Ground cinnamon, to finish 
Powdered sugar, also to finish 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with 
parchment paper. Butter the paper and the sides of the pan. Peel, halve and core your 
apples, then chop them into medium-sized chunks. (I cut each half into four “strips” 
then sliced them fairly thinly — about 1/4-inch — in the other direction.) Pile the cut 
apples directly in the prepared pan. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, using an electric mixer 
or whisk, beat eggs with sugar until thick and ribbons form on the surface of the beaten 
eggs. Beat in vanilla, then stir in flour with a spoon until just combined. The batter will be 
very thick. 
Pour over apples in pan, using a spoon or spatula to spread the batter so that it covers 
all exposed apples. (Updated to clarify: Spread the batter and press it down into the 
apple pile. The top of the batter should end up level with the top of the apples.) Bake in 
preheated oven for 55 to 60 minutes, or until a tester comes out free of batter. Cool in 
pan for 10 minutes on rack, then flip out onto another rack, peel off the parchment 
paper, and flip it back onto a serving platter. Dust lightly with ground cinnamon. 
Serve warm or cooled, dusted with powdered sugar.
