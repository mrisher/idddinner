Pork Chops in Lemon-Caper Sauce

Notes 11/12/19:

made this using pork tenderloins, no capers, dried thyme, half butter, no shallots, 8 oz of chicken stock, splash of vermouth (instead of a cup of white wine): I thought it came out great! Sauce tasted good, but looked weird. Kids liked it, but didn't love it. They really just love the pork tenderloins.

*   bone-in pork chops (about 8 ounces each)
*   Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste
*   ½ teaspoon dried thyme leaves
*   2 tablespoons olive oil
*   4 tablespoons unsalted butter
*   1 very small shallot, minced (about 1 tablespoon)
*   2 garlic cloves, minced (about 1 teaspoon)
*   2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
*   1 cup dry white wine
*   1 ½ cups chicken stock, homemade or low-sodium, if store-bought
*   2 tablespoons drained capers
*   2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley, plus more for garnish
*   1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest, plus 2 tablespoons juice
*   Hot sauce (optional)

### PREPARATION

1.  Dry the chops with paper towels, and season aggressively with salt, pepper and the thyme. Swirl the olive oil into a large skillet, and heat over medium until the oil begins to shimmer. Add chops, and cook until well browned on each side and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chops to a plate, and cover to keep warm.
2.  Drain the fat from the skillet, then melt 2 tablespoons of butter in it over medium heat until sizzling. Add the shallot and garlic, and sauté until the aromatics soften, reducing the heat if necessary, about 1 minute. Sprinkle in the flour, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Whisk in the wine and chicken stock, raise heat to high and bring the liquid to a boil, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Reduce heat to medium-high and cook, uncovered, until the liquid is reduced by half, 7 to 10 minutes.
3.  Stir in the capers, parsley, lemon zest and juice and hot sauce to taste (if you’re using it), and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter until it’s melted and the sauce looks smooth. Nestle the pork chops into the sauce, and allow them to warm up for a couple of minutes, then serve, pouring sauce over each pork chop to taste. Garnish with more fresh parsley.
