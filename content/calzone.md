What is a Calzone?
------------------

Calzones are Italian turnovers that are stuffed with an array of ingredients. Pretty much anything that goes on a pizza can go into a calzone.

The fillings are placed on one half of the circular shaped pizza dough. The dough is then folded over, pinched and sealed, coated with an egg wash or olive oil, and baked in the oven until golden brown.

What is the Difference Between Calzones and Stromboli?
------------------------------------------------------

If you love calzones, you have probably tried its close cousin, stromboli. Stromboli vs Calzone – what sets them apart? Although both have similar ingredients, the way they are sealed is different. Calzones are pinched and sealed like empanadas and are handheld, while a stromboli is rolled up and sliced.

Calzone Dough
-------------

If you’re in a pinch, grab any store-bought pizza dough to make your calzone. If you want to elevate your home cooking game, make your own [pizza dough](https://natashaskitchen.com/pizza-dough-recipe/).

As you’re rolling your dough out, pay special attention to the thickness. You want to make sure that the dough is thick enough to hold all the toppings and be folded over without breaking. ¼-inch thickness is the sweet spot.

Calzone Filling
---------------

Here are some different variations for you. Mix-and-match your ingredients to make the perfect calzone for your tastebuds:

*   **Cheese** – Mozzarella, parmesan, sharp cheddar, feta and goat cheese.
*   **Meats** – Salami, pepperoni, Canadian bacon, ham, bacon, chicken, Italian sausage, steak strips or meatballs.

How to Make Calzones
--------------------

Calzones at home are super easy. The best part about calzones is everyone can customize their own. Gather a ton of ingredients, lay them out and let your friends and family go at it! Follow these simple instructions to nail it every time:

1.  Divide pre-made pizza dough into equal portions and roll into a circle.
2.  On one half of the dough, spread all of your selected ingredients.
3.  Fold over and tightly crimp the edges.
4.  Cut air vents, brush with oil and sprinkle on parmesan. Bake at 475F for about 15 minutes or until golden brown.

Storing Calzones
----------------

**To Freeze:** Once you have prepared your calzones, you can freeze them while they are raw or cooked. Either way, place them on a baking sheet and allow them to completely freeze in a single layer. Then, store them in an airtight container or freezer-safe plastic bag.

**To Reheat:** Thaw frozen calzones in the refrigerator for 3 hours, or add more cooking time if heating from frozen. Bake raw calzones according to recipe instructions. Bake cooked calzones for half the time or until they are heated through.
