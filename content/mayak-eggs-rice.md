These **mayak eggs** are my go-to when I want something simple, satisfying, and packed with flavor. Traditionally made with soy sauce, these Korean marinated eggs (mayak gyeran) are savory, spicy, slightly sweet, and deeply umami — and in this version, they’re made soy-free and gluten-free with coconut aminos. They’re every bit as flavorful and addicting, and just as perfect over a bowl of warm rice or tucked into a lunch box.

**Jeans Notes:** Mayak eggs are soft-boiled Korean eggs marinated in soy sauce (or a soy-free substitute), garlic, chili, and sesame oil. They’re easy to make at home and typically served over rice, noodles, or as a lunchbox side.

Why You’ll Love This Recipe
---------------------------

This is one of those recipes that feels like a little secret weapon in the fridge. Soft-boiled eggs soak up a bold marinade overnight, turning into a deeply flavorful side or snack. While the traditional recipe uses soy sauce and mirin, I’ve adapted it with coconut aminos to make it friendly for those avoiding soy or gluten — and honestly, you might not even notice the swap.

The eggs come out tender with jammy yolks and a marinade that’s rich with garlic, green onions, sesame, and a touch of heat from chili peppers. It’s great for meal prep, and even better as a gateway into Korean cooking if you’re new to it, especially paired with these [Korean Dumplings (Mandu)](https://whatgreatgrandmaate.com/korean-dumplings-mandu/) for a complete banchan-style lunch. 

Each egg is packed with protein and flavor, and the whole dish is gluten-free and dairy-free. For another great fridge-friendly Korean dish, try this [Korean Cucumber Salad (Oi Muchim)](https://whatgreatgrandmaate.com/korean-cucumber-salad-oi-muchim/).

Ingredients You’ll Need

*   **Eggs:** Use large eggs and soft-boil them just until the yolks are jammy. You can also hard-boil if you prefer a firmer texture.
*   **Vinegar & Salt:** Add these to your boiling water for easy-peel shells. A small detail that makes a big difference.
*   **Coconut Aminos:** A soy-free alternative that’s naturally sweet and lower in sodium. I like this for a gluten-free marinade that still hits all the right flavor notes. Try my [Paleo Orange Chicken](https://whatgreatgrandmaate.com/paleo-whole30-orange-chicken/) for another soy-free take!)
*   **Honey:** Just a little for balance.
*   **Garlic & Green Onion:** Classic aromatics that add depth and brightness.
*   **Chili Peppers:** Red and green chilis bring color and gentle heat.
*   **Toasted Sesame Seeds & Sea Salt:** For garnish and flavor layering.

**Prefer traditional?** Use ½ cup regular soy sauce + ½ cup water in place of the coconut aminos and omit the extra salt. You’ll get the classic flavor profile with that rich, salty-sweet punch.

How to Make Mayak Eggs

**Step 1:** Bring a large pot of water to a boil with a splash of vinegar and a pinch of salt. Gently lower in your eggs and simmer for 6 minutes for soft-boiled. Add 3-5 minutes for hard-boiled.

**Step 2:** Transfer eggs to an ice bath for 5 minutes, then peel carefully.

**Step 3:** In a container just large enough to hold the eggs, stir together coconut aminos, honey, green onion, garlic, chili peppers, sea salt, and sesame seeds.

**Step 4:** Add peeled eggs, making sure they’re mostly submerged in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.

**Step 5:** Serve over hot rice or cauliflower rice, spooning plenty of marinade on top. For more easy protein recipes, you might love this [Whole30 Korean Steak Bites](https://whatgreatgrandmaate.com/whole30-korean-steak-bites/).

Recipe FAQs
-----------

****Can I use soy sauce instead of coconut aminos?**** 

Yes! Use ½ cup soy sauce + ½ cup water, and skip the added salt.

****How long should I marinate the eggs?**** 

8 hours is enough, but overnight is even better. The longer they sit, the deeper the flavor.

****How long do mayak eggs last in the fridge?**** 

They’re best within 5–7 days, stored in their marinade.

****Can I reuse the marinade?**** 

Not for more eggs. But it makes a great drizzle for stir-fries or veggies within 2 days.

****Do I need to peel the eggs before marinating?**** 

Yes — peeled eggs soak up the marinade more effectively.
