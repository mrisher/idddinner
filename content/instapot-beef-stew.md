Instapot beef stew

7/10/2025: followed the wellplated recipe. Kids loved it, just didn’t love carrots. used 1 lb beef, 1 lb lamb (both stew meat). Cut carrots a little thicker, they were too sweet. Only used about 2/3lb carrots (didn’t fit with the potatoes). Did not add peas. Takes about 1.5 hour total, but most of that is waiting in the instapot. It was really good. Next time consider 2lbs lamb, consider carrot replacement.

3/20/2025: followed the wellplated recipe almost exactly, came out great. Cut carrots at about 1.5”, potatoes a little larger than requested. Added more cornstarch slurry. Did all the browning/searing in a big cast iron, which was easier. Only problem is that total instapot time was like 1.5 hours, even though it just says 35 min. Parsley was important.

1/23/24: mixed up the recipe. 2 lbs grass fed cubed chuck, didn’t sear it very well because I overcrowded the instapot. Didn’t dice onions, didn’t notice, sauteed them in the beef jus. Added three cloves unpeeled garlic, couldn’t tell. 2 tbsp worcestershire, added tomato paste (note that I left some of this on top and it didn’t mix, so you gotta mix that shit in). ¾ box chicken bone broth. Added beans after release. Added more salt and pepper then just because

*   Too salty
*   Potatoes, carrots, beans were better (beans were a little mushy!)
*   Flavor a little worse, but hard to tell due to salt
*   Didn’t add slurry, and the broth was watery, not stewy

1/16/24: followed the wellplated recipe pretty well. Came out great (MAKE THIS AGAIN). Seared beef pretty well, used 1.5lbs non grass fed chuck (cubed myself). Kids did not like peas, carrots, or potatoes really. Carrots were a little mushy. Diced onions, added minced garlic. couldn’t tell. Not a ton of work. Needed more salt (which added well after I refrigerated). 1 tbsp worcestershire. One small box beef bone broth. Cornstarch water slurry to thicken.

*   Too liquidy
*   Great flavor
*   Wrong and too mushy veggies
