Turkey Burgers

1 lb - 1.5 lbs Ground Turkey,

1 tbsp ketchup

1 tsp worcestershire (whatever) sauce

2 cloves garlic

beaten egg

1/2 a cup panko

Needs some salt

takes about 15 min in the oven at 425 convection in a cast iron, flipping once

pretty easy and good -- still could use something to make it a little more flavorful and juicier
