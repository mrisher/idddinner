With crispy pork, a velvety sauce, and a punch of black pepper, spaghetti carbonara delivers soothing comfort and big flavor in under 30 minutes. It’s a signature Roman dish (in the same family as [cacio e pepe](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/cacio-e-pepe)) that shines by staying simple. Egg yolks provide the sauce’s luscious texture and golden hue; they’re cooked gently as you toss them with the hot pasta, so timing and following the order of operations as indicated is key.

Use quality ingredients—preferably guanciale, good cheese (such as Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano Reggiano), and [bronze-cut spaghetti](https://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/how-to-choose-and-buy-the-best-pasta-article) for a cozy dinner with flair. At dinner, this dish is nice served with a [salad of mixed greens](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/everyday-greens-salad), but when you’re in the throes of an after-hours hang, just grab a fork.

Tips and FAQs for the best spaghetti carbonara
----------------------------------------------

*   **What is guanciale? Are there any substitutes?**  
    Guanciale (cured pork jowl) is traditional in spaghetti carbonara, but pancetta or even thick-cut [American bacon](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-bacon) will be fine if you can’t find it. Don’t eat pork? Look for turkey prosciutto, beef bacon, or similar products. The key is fatty, flavorful meat.
*   **Can I add cream, garlic, or onions?**  
    Classic spaghetti carbonara doesn’t require any of these ingredients. Keep it simple with eggs, cheese, pork, pasta, and pepper for traditional texture and flavor.
*   **How do I avoid scrambled eggs?**  
    Remove the pan from the heat before adding the egg and cheese mixture. Gently toss the hot pasta with tongs or a pasta fork _while_ pouring in the mixture, plus a splash of reserved pasta water, until you achieve a smooth, creamy, emulsified sauce.
*   **Can I mix cheeses?**  
    Absolutely. Pecorino Romano is sharper and saltier; Parmesan adds nuttiness. Using a combination brings the best of both to the party. Other options include Grana Padano, Piave, and Asiago cheese, but note that these will alter the dish’s intended flavor.
*   **How much pasta water should I use?**  
    You’ll need to reserve at least ¾ cup of the salty, starchy [pasta cooking liquid](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/save-your-pasta-water). About ¼ cup of it is mixed into the egg mixture before tossing it with the pasta. With the remaining ½ cup, add just enough so the spaghetti is coated in a silky sauce. Add a splash at a time (think 1–2 Tbsp.), then toss until the consistency is glossy but not watery.
