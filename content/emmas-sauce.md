I’m sharing this with you because it’s the best sauce you’ll ever make. Serve with grilled chicken, or indeed absolutely anything:

*   3 whole jalapeño chilies, roughly chopped
*   1 tablespoon ají amarillo pepper paste
*   1 cup fresh coriander leaves
*   3 medium cloves garlic
*   1/2 cup mayonnaise
*   1/4 cup sour cream
*   2 teaspoons fresh juice from 1 lime
*   1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
*   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
*   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Combine all the ingredients in a blender, slowly drizzle in the olive oil as it’s mixing (like you’re making a mayonnaise). Season to taste. Let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before using.
