This dish is also known as **Beef Yaki Udon**, one of the most popular **Japanese stir-fries**. Yaki Udon recipes are basically made with a choice of protein, vegetables, and thick chewy udon noodles.

Cooking method is very similar to other stir fry udon noodles recipes. I've already shared my [Yaki Udon with Chicken](https://khinskitchen.com/udon-stir-fry/) and [Prawn Noodles](https://khinskitchen.com/shanghai-noodles-with-prawns/) recipes a few months back, for my friends who want to make it with chicken or prawns.

![Labelled ingredients for udon beef stir fry, placed on the white table.](https://khinskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ingredients-for-beef-udon-stir-fry.jpg)

*   **Beef:** Use beef steak like, ribeye, sirloin, tenderloin, rump, or any of your favourite tender steak cut.
*   **Noodles:** Udon is a thick chewy Japanese wheat noodles. You can buy staright-to-wok udon at most supermarket Asian aisle or fresh/frozen udon at Oriental Chinese and Korean grocery stores.
*   **Vegetables:** I add pak choi, mushroom, and onion in this recipe. Pak choi is widely available in UK supermarkets and groceries.
*   **Stir Fry Sauce:** Japanese mirin, light soy sauce and sugar are 3 key sauces to make the sauce. I add dark soy sauce for more colour and sesame oil to bring some toasty flavour. A dash of cornstarch is to thicken the sauce.

Variations and substitutes
--------------------------

*   **Udon** \- instead of ready-to-fry udon, you can use other noodles like Shanghai, Hokkien, or any thick egg/wheat noodles. Even ramen or yakisoba noodles goes well with this recipe too.
*   **Pak Choi** - it can be substitute with bok choy, choy sum, kai lan, or your choice of stir fry vegetables.
*   **Add-ons** \- other stir fry vegetables like bell pepper, snap peas, carrots, baby corns, cabbage, etc, goes well with this dish. Japanese red picked ginger gives fresh taste to the dish too. If you have it in hand you can add this as a toppings or garnish.
*   **Steak** - Instead of tender steak, you can swap with chicken, pork, or prawns. For vegetarians, swap with firm tofu or Quorn meat.
*   **Mirin -** Japanese mirin has a unique taste and flavour but if you cannot get it, use Chinese cooking wine or dry sherry instead. For non-alcochol version, substitute mirin with rice vinegar and a dash of sugar for some sweetness.
*   **Chilli** \- Authentic Japanese yaki udon dishes are mild flavour in general. If you love to bring some heat to the dish, add some fresh chilli pepper slices in the stir fry or a tablespon of chilli oil in the sauce mixture. See my homemade [chilli garlic oil](https://khinskitchen.com/homemade-chilli-oil/) on my website.

Cooking tips
------------

1.  **Cut the steak against the grain** for tender result. If you are using cheaper cuts like chuck or flank steak, add a teaspoon of corn starch and half teaspoon of baking soda, together with a tablespoon of stir fry sauce. Let it sit aside and marinade for 15 minutes. This is the simple trick to keep the meat moist and tender in your fry dishes.
2.  You can **blanch the udon noodles** with hot water or prepare by the packet instructions but it's important not to overcook them. Rinse with cold water and drain the water out after boiling/blanching.
3.  **Use large pan** or wok to give enough heat to all ingredients evenly.
