Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

23

24

Combine #1 ingredients. Add #2 ingredients. Stir in #3 ingredients.

25

Pour into a lightly greased 9 x 13 , two 9-inch pans or three 8-inch pans. (The cake is very moist so cutting parchment for the bottom of your pans will ensure they don't stick. I prefer to use the non-stick baking spray that has the flour in it for easy cake removal.)

26

Bake for 35-40 minutes for the 9x13 and 9-inch pans and 25-30 minutes for the 8-inch pans. You're looking for an inserted toothpick to come out clean.

27

Let cakes cool for 10 minutes in the pan and then remove to a cooling rack and let cool completely.
