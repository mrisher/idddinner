*   Brown Sugar Baked Sweet Potatoes and Acorn Squash

This is not the cloying, candylike sweet potato side dish that is so often topped with marshmallows. Here, the vegetable's distinctive, mellow sweetness (as well as that of the acorn squash) is augmented by hints of brown sugar and nutmeg, so that the ingredients speak for themselves. Slicing the vegetables rather than puréeing them also imparts a lovely presence—the squash looks like happy smiles, the sweet potatoes like shining coins.

ingredients
-----------

*   2 large sweet potatoes (1 3/4 pounds total), peeled and sliced crosswise 1/2 inch thick
*   1 large acorn squash (3 to 3 1/2 pounds), halved lengthwise, seeded, and sliced crosswise 1/2 inch thick
*   3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
*   1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
*   1 teaspoon grated nutmeg

preparation
-----------

Preheat oven to 375°F with racks in upper and lower thirds.

Toss sweet potatoes and squash with butter, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Divide between two 17-by 11-inch 4-sided sheet pans. Bake, switching position of pans halfway through, 25 minutes.

Stir together brown sugar and nutmeg. Turn vegetable slices and sprinkle evenly with sugar mixture. Bake until golden and tender, 35 to 40 minutes more.

cooks' note:_Vegetables can be baked 1 day ahead and chilled. Reheat in a baking dish, covered, in oven._
