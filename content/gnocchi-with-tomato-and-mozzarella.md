[Pan-fried gnocchi](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/dining/gnocchi-recipes.html) is like a faster version of baked pasta. Store-bought gnocchi can simply be browned in a pan for an exciting mix of crispy outsides and chewy middles, no boiling required. This dish is studded with juicy tomatoes and melty pockets of mozzarella. Cherry tomatoes are reliably more flavorful year-round than larger, more watery varieties like beefsteak and heirloom. (That said, taste yours, and if they’re more tart than sweet, add ½ teaspoon sugar in Step 2.) Toss the tomatoes with browned butter, red-pepper flakes and garlic, then hit them with a little heat, and they’ll burst into a bright sauce. Stir in the gnocchi, dot with mozzarella, then broil until the cheese is molten and the tomatoes are blistered in spots.

1.  Step
    
    1
    
    Heat the broiler with a rack about 6 inches from the heat source.
    
2.  Step
    
    2
    
    In a large (12-inch) skillet on the stovetop, heat enough olive oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan (about 1 tablespoon) over medium-high. Add half the gnocchi to the pan, breaking up any that are stuck together. Cover with a lid or baking sheet and cook, undisturbed, until golden brown on one side, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Repeat with the remaining gnocchi and olive oil.
    
3.  Step
    
    3
    
    Add the butter to the skillet and cook over medium-high, stirring often, until golden-brown and toasty, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the garlic, red-pepper flakes, 1½ teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper, reducing the heat slightly if necessary to avoid scorching. Add the tomatoes and 3 tablespoons water and cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the tomatoes have softened and the liquid has slightly thickened, 4 to 6 minutes. Smash the tomatoes as they burst to help them along.
    
4.  Step
    
    4
    
    Add the seared gnocchi and ¼ cup basil (if using), stir to coat, then shake into an even layer. Top with the mozzarella and drizzle lightly with olive oil. Broil until the cheese is melted and browned in spots, 2 to 4 minutes. Top with more basil, red-pepper flakes and black pepper as desired.

I've made this. Here are some tips. Do NOT sear the gnocchi as directed. They will burn. Leave them uncovered and constantly toss them while searing to achieve the "golden brown" color. Take the pan OFF the heat when browning the butter. The residual heat will ensure that you don't scorch the butter and the thinly sliced garlic. You can put it back on the heat once the residual heat in the pan abates a bit. Otherwise, a simply stellar dish that is easy and delicious. A "go-to" dish.

Use chicken broth instead of water, add your favorite nut for texture (I suggest pine nuts), and a light honey drizzle! It helps the tomato flavor to pop and contrast nicely with the crushed red pepper. Lastly, it mentions garlic in the recipe but does not note it in the ingredients, a tablespoon of minced garlic really will marinate nicely with the tomatoes.

The best refrigerated gnocchi are by Rana. Always keep a packet of them around in case rice or potatoes won’t do as starch. Their ravioli are also excellent.

I made this tonight and did not like it. However, I blame the cook and the tomatoes. Tomatoes were not good. Very little flavour but the worst thing about them was they had a pithy texture. I had read many comment prior to cooking and intended to add a drizzle of honey but I completely forgot. I think it could have been much tastier than I made, but I don’t think I would have really liked it regardless. I’m glad I made it though because it was my first time making shelf stable, ready to go gnocchi, and it was really delicious fried in olive oil with salt. Really glad I read the comment about frying while constantly stirring until golden brown. Worked really well and no burn.

I added pancetta by cooking it up in the skillet before cooking the gnocchi, and then cooked the first batch of gnocchi with the grease from the pancetta. This worked out great, and added a nice texture and flavor to the dish! Because of the saltiness of the pancetta, I also reduced the amount of salt to 1 tsp.

Would use more tomatoes!!
