Monica’s Pasta Verde

Mod 6/29

1/2 cup pine nuts

5 oz sponach

modifications 5/13/2018

used a small container of baby spinach instead. Was great.

used multigrain elbows, was fine

should have reserved some pasta water to cause to stick

best to blend all the way down to the smallest blend size so no one sees anything unpalatable.

From Monica

1 small container of basil

1/2 cup feta cheese

1/2 cup parmesan

1/4 cup toasted pine nuts

1/4 cup olive oil
