Emma’s chicken and couscous

3/30/2020

*   chicken didn't get crispy skin so had to put it in the skillet, so convection, higher temp
*   kids \*loved\* the couscous/feta/coriander
*   used orange peppers, carrots, onions. Kids like carrots/onions (unrecognizable when cubed). recognized orange peppers so didn't like it, but it was damn good.

so as always pat your chicken dry and coat generous in a mixture of oil, salt and whatever spices you feel like. zatar is great, anything yellow also great. Cut up a bunch of veg like peppers, onion, garlic, zucchini into small cubes, add a can of chickpeas, throw them all on a roasting tray and sit the chicken thighs on top

roast for 45 mins at 375

when you take it out you can put the chicken to one side and stir in cooked israeli couscous, feta and coriander. fucking bomb
