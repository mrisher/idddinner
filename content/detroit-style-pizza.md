### Why It Works

*   Using a high-hydration dough made with bread flour gives you pizza with a tender-yet-chewy, extra-crisp crust.
*   Using a specialized Detroit-style pan aids in achieving superior crust development, thanks to its dark surfaces that promote even browning and heat conduction.
*   Spreading cheese all the way to the edges of the pizza pan, before other toppings are added, lets it melt into the edges, forming a crisp, browned crust.

For the past year, I've been up to mY neck in crispy cheese crusts. That's not a bad place to be, mind you.

When did Detroit pizza become a thing? I mean, I know that rectangular pan pizzas have been served in the Motor City since at least 1946, when, according to [PMQ Pizza Media](https://www.pmq.com/detroit-style-pizza-origin/), bar owner Gus Guerra and his wife, Anna, decided to throw a batch of her mother's Sicilian dough into a blue steel pan, originally used to carry auto parts, and bake it with cheese and sauce. The pizza emerged with a blackened, lacy, crispy cheese crust all the way around the edges, and a new pizza style was born. [Buddy's](https://www.buddyspizza.com/), the restaurant opened by the Guerras, has been serving it ever since.

But that's not what I mean. When did it become a _thing_? Starting in early 2016 or so, everyone seemed to be talking about it or writing about it or opening up restaurants devoted to it. I first became aware of it back in 2008, when former Serious Eats editor and current bar pie specialist Adam Kuban included it in [his exhaustive pizza style guide](https://www.seriouseats.com/a-list-of-regional-pizza-styles-slideshow), but it wasn't until the following year, during my annual Michigan hunting trip, that I tasted it for the first time, at a Buddy's in Detroit.  

What Is Detroit-Style Pizza?
----------------------------

Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt

To be frank, I don't know why it didn't blow up earlier. The stuff is freaking delicious. Let's start from the bottom and work our way up: The crust comes out crisp and golden on the bottom, with a lightly fried texture that it gets from sizzling in the rendered fat that drips down from the cheese. Next, we move on to the crumb, which is chewy, with a medium-fine bubble structure. Not so rustic as, say, a focaccia, but not quite as soft and fluffy as a New York–style Sicilian slice.

Above that is where things get a little topsy-turvy. Instead of using the "sauce, cheese, toppings" order of a typical pizza, Detroit pizzas are built in reverse. Creamy, tangy brick cheese from Wisconsin is cubed and applied directly to the top of the dough, where it bakes up gooey, buttery, and thick in the middle, crispy and dark brown around the edges. On top of the cheese is a sweet, thick tomato sauce, seasoned with plenty of garlic and spices and often applied in heavy parallel bands. If you order the pizza with pepperoni (the most common topping), depending on where you are, you might find it cupped and crisp on top of the sauce, or, occasionally, buried underneath the cheese, where its flavor seeps in and penetrates every bite.\* It's crispy, fatty, cheesy, tangy, and glorious, especially those coveted corner pieces that give you that extra crunch.

_\*Should we call them "middlings" instead of "toppings" if they're stuck in the middle?_

This is not everyday pizza. It's not every-week pizza. It might not even be every-month, if you want to live to a reasonable age. But damn, is it _good_ pizza. So good that it's worth a trip to Detroit just to taste it. So good that it's worth devoting months of time, weeks of research, and dozens and dozens of experiments to developing a recipe to duplicate it at home. So that's exactly what I did. Here's what I found.

Finding the Perfect, Chewy Crust
--------------------------------

I decided to start my testing by focusing on the crust. For these tests, I used low-moisture mozzarella and a jar of Rao's for the sauce. Since I already have an easy [recipe for foolproof pan pizza](https://www.seriouseats.com/foolproof-pan-pizza-recipe), I started there, figuring I could tweak it to make it work for a Detroit pie. That recipe uses a basic no-knead method: Flour and water are combined with yeast (1% of the flour by weight) and salt (2.5% of the flour by weight) and mixed together in a bowl, just until a shaggy dough forms. The bowl is then covered and set aside overnight. During that overnight rest, yeast multiplies and produces bubbles of carbon dioxide that slowly expand and rise, in effect kneading the dough for you. In the morning, you wind up with a stretchy, relaxed dough with plenty of gluten development.

A little too much gluten development, as it turned out.

Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt

Good gluten development and a nicely relaxed, high-moisture dough lead to a very rustic hole structure, with a hearty chew and a mix of big, small, and medium-sized bubbles. It's delicious, but Detroit pizza should be a little more uniform. Still, I liked the idea of a no-knead dough, so I tried it a few more times, using different ratios of flour to water. In baker-speak, this is known as "hydration level": A "60% hydration dough" is a dough that uses 60 grams of water for every 100 grams of flour. My original pan pizza has a hydration level of about 70%. I tried going down as low as 60%, which made a dough that had a finer hole structure (good!) but also a denser, tougher texture (bad!).

Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt

After a few more experiments (mostly around adding a fat to the dough, with the idea of making it a little more tender), I decided to throw in the towel on the no-knead method and switch to a more traditional kneading-based approach.\*\*

_\*\* NB: No-knead is still a fantastic way to make pizza or bread if a rustic crumb is what you're after!_

In doing a bit more research, I found that [Adam Kuban had gone down a similar path](http://www.adamkuban.com/2013/02/detroit-style-pizza-75-hydration-all-purpose-flour/) years ago while exploring hydration levels in Detroit-style dough. According to him, using all-purpose flour and a super-high hydration level of 75% is the key. I mixed up another batch, this time using my stand mixer to make the dough. I started by combining the ingredients and mixing them just until they started to come together, then let them rest for 10 minutes before continuing to knead.  

This is a method called autolyse, during which an enzymatic breakdown of flour protein occurs,\*\*\* making it easier to subsequently form gluten. Think of it sort of like converting a Lego spaceship into a castle: It's easiest if you break it down completely before starting to rebuild. Once the dough was kneaded, I let it rise for a couple hours at room temperature before turning it into a greased pan (more on that pan later). I let it rest once more to allow the gluten to relax, then stretched it out until it filled out the pan all the way to the edges, before topping and baking it in a hot oven.

_\*\*\* Technically, an autolyse is made before salt is added, but I've never really found a big difference between adding the salt at the start and adding it at the end._

Adam is right that high hydration is a great way to go (though I ended up scaling my water back to around 73% instead of 75%), but I wasn't fully convinced about the all-purpose flour. Because all-purpose flour is relatively low in protein, it produces a light, very tender crumb that doesn't have quite the chew or pull I was looking for.

Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt

Swapping out that all-purpose flour for bread flour (I used King Arthur bread flour) was the real key, producing a crumb structure that was relatively open and chewy, but still squarely on the Detroit pizza end of the scale as opposed to the focaccia end.  

Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt

In the past, [I've written glowingly about doughs made in a food processor](https://www.seriouseats.com/new-york-style-pizza), and I'm happy to report that this dough also works fabulously well in a food processor. Just dump the ingredients in, set the machine running until a ball of dough forms (that usually takes about 15 seconds), then let that ball of dough ride around the blade for 30 seconds longer. You'll be amazed at how quickly it develops an incredibly smooth, silky gluten structure. If you have a powerful food processor (our [review of the best food processors is right here](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-food-processor-equipment-review)) and are making only a couple batches of dough, it'll leave the stand mixer in the dust.

Finding the Best Cheese and Pan
-------------------------------

With the dough out of the way, I turned my attention to the cheese. Detroit pizza is unusual in two ways when it comes to cheese. The first is the use of brick cheese, a high-fat aged cheese from Wisconsin with a uniquely tangy, salty, buttery flavor that's hard to replace with alternatives. The second is the edges. If you've ever been to [Pequod's or Burt's Place in Chicago](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-deep-dish-pizza-in-chicago-5181624), or, better yet, had a pizza from [Windy City Pie](https://windycitypie.com/) in Seattle (incidentally, the best Chicago-style pan pizza I've ever had anywhere, including in Chicago), then you're familiar with the concept of a crispy, blackened cheese crust—the shelf of crisp, lacy cheese that surrounds the edge of the pizza. This is where the real magic of Detroit-style pizza lies, and, as I found out, getting it is not exactly straightforward.  

Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt

For my testing, I ordered a ton of brick cheese from Amazon. If you order in bulk, it's relatively inexpensive, and worth it if authenticity is what you're after. (Don't worry; I also found some viable alternatives sold in supermarkets.) When I visited Dave Lichterman, the man behind Windy City Pie, in his Seattle kitchen a few months ago, he showed me how he makes his cheese crust. He starts by filling out a pan with dough, then lays overlapping _slices_ of cheese (not grated cheese!) on top, letting each one ride off the edge of the pan to line the sides, where they crisp and bake into shape.

I tried that method with my Detroit-style pizza, but the problem was slicing the brick cheese—it's very soft, which makes slicing an almost impossible endeavor. Just for kicks, I tried using presliced supermarket cheeses of various flavors. None of them seemed to crisp up the way Dave's does.

I wondered if the shape of the cheese wasn't the only issue. Up until now, I'd been cooking my pizza in standard aluminum rimmed baking sheets. Maybe there is some truth to what people say about those special Detroit pans being the secret ingredient in Detroit pizza?

The classic Detroit pizza pan is a deep, 10- by 14-inch rectangle of metal with black surfaces (for better conduction) and sides that flare gently away from the bottom. While the original pans were made from blue steel, most modern pans are made from anodized aluminum and come with a nonstick coating. I tested a number of these pans and found that yes, the black surfaces really did make a difference in how well that cheese crisped.

The best one I tried was from [LloydPans](https://lloydpans.com/detroit-style-pizza-pans.html). They've been making these pans since the '80s. This is a specialty item for sure, but once you try this recipe, I can guarantee that you'll be using it with regularity. Still, if you don't want a dedicated pizza pan, I found that you can get decent results from a pair of deep, well-seasoned or nonstick 8- by 8-inch cake pans.\*\*\*\*

\*\*\*\* _The crust doesn't come out quite as nice when you use a pair of cake pans, but you do end up with more of it because of the two extra edges, so it's a pretty fair trade._  

Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt

After stretching my dough, I added a layer of diced brick cheese, which I made sure to spread all the way to the very edges of the pan. Buddy's in Detroit claims that it uses a full pound of cheese for each pizza. I've seen some recipes that call for eight ounces or less. I ended up splitting the difference by adding 12 ounces of diced cheese. Don't get me wrong: It's still a _ton_\*\*\*\*\* of cheese, but not so much that eating it becomes painful.

_\*\*\*\*\* Not literally a ton._

Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt

Ya see how nice that cheese-and-pan combo works out? For the record, the cheese crust may look black, but I can assure you that it does not taste burnt or bitter. I can't explain it.

Swapping out that brick cheese for a different cheese turned out to be surprisingly difficult. Not only does brick cheese have its own flavor, it's also extremely high in fat, which is important. As that butterfat drips down into the pan, it fries directly into the crust. Many people note that Detroit pizza has a buttery flavor despite containing no butter at all; that flavor comes from the brick cheese fat.

At [Tony's Pizza Napoletana](http://tonyspizzanapoletana.com/) in San Francisco, owner and pizza savant Tony Gemignani uses cheddar around the edges. The cheddar comes out reasonably lacy and crisp, but the flavor reminds me more of a crisp-edged grilled cheese. I tried sliced and cubed low-moisture mozzarella and young, soft Jack. I even gave havarti a go. In the end, the closest substitute I could find was a 50/50 mix of low-moisture mozzarella (which provides some of that clean, buttery dairy flavor) and Jack (which has plenty of fat and also tanginess).

Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt

Like tuning into a _Bill Nye_ marathon when you're in the mood for _Mr. Wizard_, it's not quite the same, but it'll leave you mostly satisfied.

Seasoning the Sauce
-------------------

Compared to the struggles I went through to nail the crust and cheese, the sauce was a piece of cake. Unlike a typically sparse Neapolitan- or New York–style pizza sauce, Detroit-style pizza sauces are usually heavily seasoned with aromatics. To make mine, I started by sautéing fresh garlic, a little pinch of pepper flakes, and a good amount of dried oregano in extra-virgin olive oil before adding tomatoes. I generally recommend using whole peeled tomatoes that you crush yourself by hand, as whole peeled tomatoes exhibit more consistency than other types of processed tomatoes. But in this case, without a food mill, it's hard to get the uniform crushed texture that you want in Detroit-style pizza sauce, so I opted for canned crushed tomatoes instead.\*\*\*\*\*\* So long as you use a good-quality brand, like Muir Glen, Bianco DiNapoli, or Cento D.O.P. San Marzanos, crushed will do just fine.

_\*\*\*\*\*\* Little CA-living brag here: The very best sauce I made was from the San Marzanos I grew and canned myself last summer. Thpbhbpbhpbphpbtbh._

Some recipes call for canned pizza sauce or tomato paste. I find that both can dull flavor too much, so I prefer to simmer down my tomatoes until they're nicely reduced and intensely flavored.

My sauce was tasty, but it was still missing something. I'm generally a "fresh garlic all the way" type of guy, but I couldn't shake the feeling that granulated garlic powder might be that missing element. Turns out I was right.

Adding a small dash of granulated garlic and granulated onion, along with a bit of sugar, was the key. Now, I know from experience how uncomfortable people can get about [sugar in their tomato sauce](https://www.seriouseats.com/new-york-style-pizza-sauce), so I'll tell you right now: I don't care. If putting sugar in tomato sauce offends you, by all means, keep it sugar-free. I promise I won't stop you. Meanwhile, I'll be over here, eating my delicious pizza, and no, you can't have any.  

There's a school of thought that suggests waiting to add sauce to a Detroit pizza until _after_ it comes out of the oven. That's not a bad way to do it, but I prefer the cosmic oneness that the pizza achieves when the cheese and sauce are cooked together.

Toppings and Baking
-------------------

The only thing left to address is how to add toppings and bake this thing. You can feel free to use whatever toppings you personally like, but to my mind, pepperoni is the only real choice here.

Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt

I mentioned before that some restaurants like to place the pepperoni under the cheese, while others place it on top. I really do like the way the flavor gets integrated into the dough when you place the pepperoni underneath, but giving up those crisp, charred edges from [pepperoni cooked on top of the pie](https://www.seriouseats.com/spicy-spring-sicilian-pizza-recipe) physically pains me, so I thought: Por que no los dos?  

Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt

Laying pepperoni out under _and_ over the pie gives you the best of both worlds. Incidentally, make sure to use a high-quality natural-casing pepperoni, like Vermont Smoke & Cure, or even Boar's Head (the stick version, _not_ the presliced!). That's how you guarantee that your pepperoni will cup up into those crispy little grease chalices that Adam Kuban is so fond of.\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

_\*\*\*\*\*\*\* You can read up a bit on the fascinating [science of what makes pepperoni curl](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-pizza-lab-why-does-pepperoni-curl) right here._

The only thing left to test was baking, and, unfortunately, here's where things get a wee bit hairy. The problem is that ovens are not very accurate, or even uniform. Most ovens tend to heat more from the bottom than from the top, but some are the opposite. Some ovens maintain a steady temperature, while others fluctuate wildly up and down.

I have a few pieces of advice here. First, set the oven as hot as it will get. In a home oven, that's 500 to 550°F (260 to 290°C). At those temperatures, you get good browning and crisping of the crust before the dough has a chance to dry out too much. But even then, you might find that the top of your pizza ends up cooking before the bottom does. If you know that your oven doesn't heat much from the bottom, or if you make the recipe and find the base is not quite as crisp as you like, you have a couple options.

First is to place the pan on top of a preheated [Baking Steel](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-pizza-lab-the-baking-steel-delivers), which will help pump heat into the base of the pizza, where it's needed most. Your second option is to place the pizza directly on the floor of a preheated oven, which will also give it a nice, quick energy boost.  

Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt

In a hot oven, the pizza cooks in about 12 to 15 minutes. You'll know it's done when the cheese around the edges is sizzling and black and the top is very lightly browned.  

Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt

Once it comes out of the oven, use a thin metal spatula to carefully prise the edges away from the pan, giving the whole thing a few shakes until it seems to move around freely.  

Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt

From there, transfer the pizza to a cutting board, and do your best not to immediately plant your face in it. That's rude. And also liable to give you severe burns on your eyeballs. That's something nobody likes.  

You know what's something that _everybody_ likes? Delicious pizza. Like the one you're going to make this week.

I mean, just look at that crumb. Oh, oh! And let me show you the best part:  

Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt

Now that? That's the stuff that dreams are made of. Welcome to Detroit, my friends.  

### February 2017

Keep Screen Awake

For the Dough:

*   300 g bread flour (10.5 ounces; about 2 generous cups)
    
*   5 g instant yeast (0.15 ounce; about 1 teaspoon), such as SAF Instant Yeast
    
*   9 g salt (0.3 ounce; about 1 1/2 teaspoons table salt or 1 tablespoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt)
    
*   220 g water (7.75 ounces; about 1 cup minus 1 1/2 teaspoons)
    
*   Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed
    

For the Sauce:

*   2 tablespoons (30 ml) extra-virgin olive oil
    
*   3 medium cloves garlic, minced
    
*   2 teaspoons (about 5 g) dried oregano
    
*   Dash red pepper flakes
    
*   1 (28-ounce; 800 g) can high-quality crushed tomatoes
    
*   1 teaspoon (about 6 g) granulated garlic powder
    
*   1 teaspoon (about 6 g) granulated onion powder
    
*   1 tablespoon (about 15 g) sugar
    
*   Kosher salt, to taste
    

To Finish:

*   12 ounces (340 g) brick cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (see notes)
    
*   12 ounces (340 g) high-quality natural-casing pepperoni, such as Boar's Head or Vermont Smoke & Cure, cut into 1/8-inch slices (optional)
    

1.  **To Make the Dough in a Stand Mixer:** Combine flour, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Stir to combine, then add water. Mix on low speed until dough comes together into a rough ball, then shut off mixer and let rest for 10 minutes. Continue mixing at medium-low speed until dough forms a smooth, silky ball, about 10 minutes longer. (It should stick to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads rather than riding around the edges.) Remove dough hook, form dough into a tight ball, set in the bottom of the mixer bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
    
    Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt
    
2.  **To Make the Dough in a Food Processor:** Combine flour, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine. Add water, then turn on processor and process until dough forms a ball that rides around the bowl of the processor, about 30 seconds. Continue processing for 30 seconds longer. Transfer dough to a bowl, form a tight ball, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
    
3.  **To Make the Dough by Hand:** Combine flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk to combine, then add water and stir with a wooden spoon until a rough ball of dough has formed. Set aside for 10 minutes. Turn dough out onto a countertop and knead until a smooth, silky ball has formed, about 10 minutes. Transfer dough to a bowl, form a tight ball, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
    
4.  Pour a couple tablespoons olive oil in the bottom of a Detroit-style anodized aluminum pan or two 8- by 8-inch cake pans. (Split dough in half if using cake pans.) Transfer dough to pan(s) and turn to coat in oil. Press down on dough and spread it toward the edges. You won't be able to get it all the way to the edges; this is okay. Spread it as much as you can without tearing, then cover tightly in plastic and set aside for 30 minutes to allow dough to relax. Return to dough and stretch it out again. It should be able to reach the edges this time. If not, let it rest a little more and try again. To get the dough to stay in the corners, stretch it up beyond the corners so that it pulls back into place. Once dough is stretched, cover again and set aside while you make the sauce.
    
    Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt
    
5.  **For the Sauce:** Adjust oven rack to lowest position and preheat oven to 550°F (290°C), or as close to it as your oven gets. Heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add minced garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes, garlic powder, onion powder, and sugar. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced to about 3 cups, about 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt.
    
    Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt
    
6.  **To Form the Pizza:** Press down on dough with your fingertips to remove any large air bubbles. Lay half of pepperoni (if using) evenly over face of dough. Top with cheese, spreading it evenly all the way to the very edges of the pan, then add remaining pepperoni. Spoon sauce over surface in 3 even rows. (You will need only about half the sauce—save the rest for another pizza.)
    
    Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt
    
7.  Transfer to oven and bake until edges are black and bubbly and exposed cheese on top is starting to lightly brown, 12 to 15 minutes. (If your oven doesn't cook well from the bottom, consider placing the pizza directly on the oven floor.) Transfer to a trivet or folded kitchen towel on countertop.
    
    Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt
    
8.  Run a thin metal spatula all the way around the edges of the pan to loosen the pizza. Carefully lift it out and slide it onto a cutting board. Cut pizza and serve.

Special Equipment
-----------------

[Stand mixer](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-stand-mixers-7377555) or [food processor](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-food-processor-equipment-review) (optional), Detroit-style 10- by 14-inch anodized aluminum pan (see notes)

Notes
-----

Brick cheese is a [high-fat aged cheese from Wisconsin](https://www.wisconsincheese.com/find-cheese/ch/8/brick). It has a buttery flavor and browns very well, giving Detroit pizza its distinct flavor. You can order it online from Amazon. If it's unavailable, you can use a combination of Jack or young cheddar and low-moisture mozzarella.

For best results, use a [Detroit-style anodized aluminum pan](https://www.seriouseats.com/essential-tools-for-baking-pizza-at-home). If you can't get your hands on that kind of pan, you can split the recipe into two square [8- by 8-inch cake pans](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-baking-pans-8656811).
