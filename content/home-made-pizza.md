Home made Neapolitan style pizza
For five pizzas:
750 grams of high quality bread flour
450 grams of water (that’s 450 ml on a fluid measuringcup)
4 teaspoons of salt
1/4 teaspoon of dry yeast
I use the Dough function on my bread maker, but youcan mix and knead by hand and let rise.
This is the result: I nice, firm ball of dough, whichyou can knead a couple of times more and shape ina ball

Then you portion it, cutting off chunks of dough of 230-250 grams
You repeat the process for all the dough

Then, you work those into balls. There are plentyof ways of doing it, here’s one:

Then , you take five sealable containers slightlybigger than the balls to allow for them to rise, andyou wipe the inside
with olive oil to prevent them from sticking

Then you place the dough balls in the containers

And seal them shut

Now you let them rise in the fridge for at least 24hours, up to 1-3 days, to taste. The dough risesslowly and ferments
altering texture and improving flavor.
This is what it looks like after a day and a half:many small air pockets, still round-ish in shape

After some experimentation, I find that 48 hours givesthe best flavor and plasticity
The dough balls should be removed from the fridgeabout 4 hours before use, and the lids about 30 minutesbefore
use

Both steps are important, because if the dough isstill cold it’s a lot harder to work with, and ifyou don’t let it dry
enough without the lid it’ll be too wet and requiretoo much flour to prevent it from sticking to thework surface and
your hands
Once the oven is at temperature (baking store closeto 1000 degrees, you transfer a dough ball to thework surface.

When the dough ball is on the work surface, the firststep is to use your fingertips to push the air bubblesfrom the
center to the crust. Never use a rolling pin, as you’lllose all the air pockets and the pizza won’t rise

After that step, shape the pizza in a circle. Thereare plenty of videos on YouTube on how to do that.It’s much harder
than it seems

Once it’s shaped into a disc , it’s important to putit on the peel before adding the toppings

Sprinkle some cornmeal under the pizza: it preventsit from sticking and unlike regular flour it doesn’tburn
At this point, you just put the toppings and cook,as quickly as possible as it you let it sog withwet ingredients you
increase the risk of it sticking to the peel
For cheese part, you can go very fancy as you wantbut personally I find TJ’s low moisture mozzarellais a great price
/ quality
For the tomato, I personally Italian style passata(sprouts has a good option) which has just tomato,no additional
ingredients
To be clear, all this is the result of trial and error,combining different online sources until I founda good combination
of simplicity and closeness to the pizza I’d eat athome. The fun part is to continue tweaking to tastes
