Thai Pumpkin Curry is a delicious and satisfying meal that takes just 25 minutes to make. This version is vegan (as long as you use vegan fish sauce), but you can use regular fish sauce if you prefer) and includes chickpeas, but you can add tofu, chicken, beef, pork, or shrimp if you like.

**What is Thai Pumpkin Curry?**
-------------------------------

Thai Pumpkin Curry is a spicy curry made with sweet cubed pumpkin and Thai curry paste. It has a rich [coconut milk](https://amzn.to/3Li1mle) base, which mellows out the spicy kick of the curry paste a bit. It is one of the best savory pumpkin recipes I know.

I use fresh pumpkin in this delicious Thai Pumpkin Curry rather than puree because I like to puree only part of it, giving it a thick texture with some tender chunks of pumpkin. You could add a cup of pumpkin puree if you want to skip the part of the recipe where you pull out some of the pumpkin to blend it.

This recipe includes chickpeas for some protein, making it a satisfying one-pot meal. But you can substitute tofu for the chickpeas if you like. If you're not vegetarian, feel free to add chicken, pork, beef, or shrimp.

You can add other vegetables, too, like carrots, broccoli, green beans, zucchini, or eggplant. More vegetables will only make this dish even more satisfying and nutritious.

What kind of pumpkin should you use?
------------------------------------

The best pumpkin to use for Thai Pumpkin Curry is any good eating pumpkin. I like sugar pumpkins, Japanese pumpkins, and other types of squash in the same family, like kabocha squash, acorn squash, or butternut squash.

**What is the best brand of Thai curry paste?**
-----------------------------------------------

Thai [red curry paste](https://www.amazon.com/Mae-Ploy-Curry-Paste-Large/dp/B0044PYPVC?tag=twola-20) is a condiment that combines garlic, red chiles, lemongrass, shallots, galangal, shrimp paste, makrut lime zest, and other seasonings into one spicy, flavorful paste.

There are several brands available in the US, which vary in terms of flavor and heat level. Which you like best will depend on your personal preference for spice level and flavor.

I love a spicy kick and [Mae Ploy](https://www.amazon.com/Mae-Ploy-Curry-Paste-Large/dp/B0044PYPVC?tag=twola-20) brand curry paste delivers that. You can buy it in any Thai or Asian grocery store or online. [Maesri](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MH0P5Q/ref=as_li_tl?tag=twola-20) is another very popular brand that tastes great.

[Thai Kitchen](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LKVSDM?tag=twola-20) brand curry paste is milder and also may be more widely available where you live. You can find Thai Kitchen brand in most supermarkets or online.
