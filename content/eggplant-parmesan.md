> **Scraped from [smitten kitchen](https://smittenkitchen.com/2023/09/simple-eggplant-parmesan/)**

[Last year](https://smittenkitchen.com/2022/09/eggplant-involtini/) I told you that despite it being the opposite of eggplant season, I crave eggplant parmesan incessantly each winter. I mean, who doesn’t want an aromatic, cheese-stretchy, cozy casserole of ziti-like flavors, but without the heaviness of the pasta sometimes, right? What this post omitted was my recipe, which was kind of rude. The truth is that I wasn’t completely comfortable sharing the recipe because it’s not a True eggplant parmesan, or so I believed. It’s not breaded, it’s not fried, and there’s definitely no ricotta. Even the title of the recipe as it was saved on my computer was self-conscious: _(Not Really) Eggplant Parmesan_.

So what changed? [Going to Italy this summer!](https://smittenkitchen.com/travel/two-weeks-in-italy/) We ordered eggplant parmesan (parmigiana di melanzane) almost every time we saw it on the menu and do you know what would come out? A dish that looked like this — no breading, no crumbs, no ricotta. It made more sense when I read about the [history of the dish from Emiko Davies](https://food52.com/blog/13926-what-does-classic-eggplant-parmigiana-really-mean) which I’ll simply link to rather than poorly summarize (it’s fascinating!) but it also gave me the nudge to finally spring the recipe from my kitchen to yours.

I think it’s heavenly: Thick slices of fresh eggplant are salted, dabbed dry, and roasted in a generous application of olive oil at high heat until deeply brown on both sides — i.e. almost like fried but without the oil splatters and spread of paper towels to drain the grease. While they roast, you make a simple tomato sauce on the stove with onion, garlic, and pepper flakes softened in olive oil. You fan the slices of eggplant in a dish with sauce under and over them, cover it with a heap of mozzarella and parmesan, and bake it until blistered, cozy, and absolutely spoonable, with stretches of cheese trying to drag each spoonful back to the pan. Spoiler: It will fail; you will win.

### Simple Eggplant Parmesan

*   2 pounds eggplant, cut into generous 1/2-inch slices
*   Kosher salt
*   Olive oil
*   Freshly ground black pepper
*   1 small onion, finely chopped
*   3 garlic cloves, minced
*   1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
*   1 28-ounce can of whole tomatoes
*   1 teaspoon dried oregano
*   Handful fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped
*   1/2 cup finely grated parmesan or pecorino cheese
*   8 ounces grated or thinly-sliced mozzarella

**Prepare the eggplant:** Arrange eggplant slices on a large (half-sheet) baking pan in one layer. Sprinkle with about 2 teaspoons kosher salt and set aside for 30 minutes.

**Heat oven:** To 425°F (220°C) degrees.

**Roast eggplant:** Transfer eggplant slices to paper towels and blot them of as much excess water as possible. Dry the baking sheet, too, and coat it with 3 tablespoons of olive oil and sprinkle the oil with several grinds of black pepper. Arrange eggplant slices in one layer. Drizzle with 2 more tablespoons of oil and more grinds of black pepper. Roast until nicely browned underneath, 20 to 25 minutes. Use a thin spatula to turn eggplant slices over and roast until browned underneath on the second side, another 10 minutes. It’s okay if they’re not cooked through yet. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F (175°C).

**Meanwhile, make sauce:** While eggplant roasts, open your can of tomatoes and use kitchen shears or very well-washed scissors to chop the tomatoes into small bits. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium/large saucepan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add onion and cook until it softens, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and pepper flakes and cook another minute. Add tomatoes (beware the splatter!), oregano, and season with 1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste. Let mixture simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. If you’d like the sauce smoother than it is now, you can mash the tomatoes further with a potato masher as it cooks, or use an immersion blender for a completely smooth sauce. Stir in basil then taste the sauce; adjust salt and pepper to taste.

**Assemble:** In a 1.5- to 2-quart baking dish (holding 6 to 8 cups; I’m using [this](https://amzn.to/46kTCsX)), spoon about 1/2 cup of the sauce. Arrange about half of the eggplant slices, slightly overlapped, in one layer. Spoon another 1/2 cup sauce over and spread it evenly. Arrange remaining eggplant slices, then ladle more sauce over it so it’s as saucy as you like. \[Keep unused sauce in fridge for another day; it will keep for 4 to 5 days.\] Sprinkle top with mozzarella and parmesan.

**Bake:** For 30 minutes, until cheese has melted and sauce is bubbling all over. For more color on top, you can run it briefly under your oven’s broiler.

**To serve:** Once baked, let the eggplant parmesan rest at room temperature, if you can bear it, for 15 minutes before digging in — this helps the ingredients settle and come together more. It’s not mandatory, but this is excellent with a side of [garlic bread](https://smittenkitchen.com/2016/04/perfect-garlic-bread/).

**Do ahead:** Eggplant parmesan keeps fantastically in the fridge for up to 5 days. Rewarm in a 350-degree oven, covered for the first half of the time, for about 25 to 30 minutes. You can also freeze it, well wrapped, for a few months.
