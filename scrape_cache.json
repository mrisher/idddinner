The warm yogurt sauce adds tang and richness, along with a sprinkling of tart sumac powder and chopped mint. American \"Greek-style\" yogurt is not always tart enough, but it can be thinned with a bit of buttermilk or even lemon juice. Whisking it with cornstarch and egg produces a silky sauce.

Step\n    \n    1\n    \n    In a large bowl, use your hands to combine lamb, breadcrumbs, salt, pepper, onion, cumin, coriander, cinnamon and cayenne. Beat 2 of the eggs and add to meat, mixing until incorporated. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes to 24 hours to allow the seasonings to permeate the meat.\n    \n2.  Step\n    \n    2\n    \n    Using wet hands, break off walnut-sized pieces of lamb mixture, roll into spheres and set aside on a baking sheet. You should have about 30 1-ounce meatballs.\n    \n3.  Step\n    \n    3\n    \n    Heat oven to 225 degrees. In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. When shimmering, add meatballs in one layer and brown for 2 to 3 minutes.

It takes a little elbow grease, but is worth it. I used a potato masher to mix the meat and spices and then used a cookie scoop for the meatballs. Not looking to start some big debate about my methods...but those two steps help make this a little quicker for me. Also, I just bake the meatballs in the oven at 400 for 20 mins and skip the pan fry.\n\nPut the dill and mint in the meatballs as per other comments and that was awesome! Added one lemon juiced to Fage 2% and that was perfect tartness. Delicious recipe!\n\nFor folks that don't like the taste of yogurt, is there another sauce to use - maybe one with tahini?\n\nI took the advice and incorporated the mint and dill in the meatball, and cooked them in the oven at 400 (no pan fry). The yogurt sauce is good, but not great and so, for me not worth the effort. Next time, I will just mix some greek yogurt with feta cheese, some lemon and sumac or za'tar.\n\nThis was lovely! I added dill and mint to the meatballs as others suggested, and since I had them, used some crushed Urfa chile at the end in lieu of crushed hot red pepper. Loved the herbs, turmeric, and sumac. So flavorful. Felt very spring like. I served it with orzo, the NYT Taverna salad and an olive oil cake for dessert. 100% NYT menu. Dinner for 5 and it was a hit.\n\nPrivate comments are only visible to you.",

The cucumber salad is light and fresh with coconut milk and asian flavors. All served over black rice for am easy, delicious meal in less than 40 minutes.\n\n![Blackened Miso Salmon with Creamy Coconut Cucumber Salad](https://i0.wp.com/wanderingchickpea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSCF1446-1.jpg?resize=800%2C1067&ssl=1)\n\nHow to Make Miso **Blackened** Salmon\n-------------------------------------\n\nThis Blackened Miso Salmon is super simple, all you do is marinate the fish on the counter for about 15-20 minutes then pop it under the broiler for about 10 minutes.\n\nThe marinade is a blend of soy sauce, honey, miso and lime juice. It’s the perfect marinade, but also a great sauce for drizzling over the fish once it’s cooked, so **reserve about 1/4 cup before adding the fish!**\n\nOnce the salmon has absorbed some of those delicious flavors, turn on the broiler and place an oven rack about six inches below the heating element. This prevents the salmon from burning or even catching fire. To cook the salmon, I used a broil pan but a foil lined baking sheet would work too.\n\nRemember to keep a close eye on the salmon while it’s under the broiler. Due to the salmon’s proximity to the heat, the sugars from the honey and miso will caramelize, while the inside stays nice and tender. Everyone’s oven is a little bit different so you want to watch out for burning. Even though this salmon is meant to be “blackened,” you just want a little color around the edges, truly burnt fish will be bitter.\n\nServe the Blackened Miso Salmon fresh out of the oven with a drizzle of that reserved marinade. I like to remove the skin before plating but do whatever you like!\n\n![Blackened Miso Salmon](https://i0.wp.com/wanderingchickpea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSCF1412.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1)\n\nThis Miso Blackened Salmon also tastes delicious when cooked in the air fryer. The method is very similar to the broiler. Just place your salmon filets in the basket of the air fryer and cook for about 5 minutes. Brush over some of the remaining marinade and air fry for an additional 2-4 minutes or until the salmon is cooked to your liking.\n\nCreamy **Coconut** **Cucumber** Salad\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe Blackened Miso Salmon will take about 15 minutes to marinate, so that’s the perfect amount of time to make the Coconut Cucumber Salad!\n\nThis salad was inspired by those heavy cucumber salads made with sour cream and dill. This one uses coconut milk instead, so it’s a little lighter, dairy free and (in my opinion) more flavorful. Make sure to use full fat, unsweetened coconut milk. This is going to make the salad super creamy and rich.\n\nVery straightforward to make, just slice your cucumber, chop the scallions and a little cilantro. Toss everything together in a large bowl with the coconut milk, lime juice and lime zest before tasting and adding salt. This type of coconut milk has a tendency to separate, so be sure to shake the can before opening. The salad can sit at room temperature while the salmon cooks or be refrigerated and made in advance.\n\n![Creamy Coconut Cucumber Salad](https://i0.wp.com/wanderingchickpea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSCF1405.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1)\n\nTips For **Serving**\n--------------------\n\nI served my Blackened Miso Salmon and cucumber salad over some black rice, also called “Forbidden Rice.” It goes perfectly with these flavors if you can find it. If not, cook up some short grain brown or white rice instead.\n\nI also added a sprinkle of red chili flakes over the whole dish for a bit of heat. This is optional, but it does go really nicely with the coolness from the cucumber salad.\n\n![Blackened Miso Salmon with Creamy Coconut Cucumber Salad](https://i0.wp.com/wanderingchickpea.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSCF1448.jpg?resize=683%2C1024&ssl=1)\n\nMore Recipes to Try\n-------------------\n\n*   [Honey BBQ salmon tacos with mango slaw](https://wanderingchickpea.com/2021/06/14/honey-bbq-salmon-tacos-with-mango-slaw/)\n*   [Crunchy brown rice bowls with salmon](https://wanderingchickpea.com/2021/05/03/crunchy-brown-rice-bowls-with-salmon-and-herbed-tahini-dressing/)\n*   [Honey sesame chickpea lettuce wraps](https://wanderingchickpea.com/2021/05/12/honey-sesame-chickpea-lettuce-wraps/)\n*   [Ginger peach meatballs with coconut rice](https://wanderingchickpea.com/2021/07/09/ginger-peach-meatballs-with-coconut-rice/)\n*   [Black pepper noodles with honey roasted edamame](https://wanderingchickpea.com/2021/08/28/black-pepper-noodles-with-honey-roasted-edamame/)\n\nMade this **recipe**?

If you don’t own a rice cooker but have an Instant Pot, you can definitely use this smart device to make rice. Today, we’ll go over **how to cook rice in an Instant Pot**, along with some important tips I’ve learned from my experiments.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n*   [The 3 Dilemmas of Making Rice with the Instant Pot](#h-the-3-dilemmas-of-making-rice-with-the-instant-pot)\n*   [Finally, the Testing](#h-finally-the-testing)\n*   [5 Most Important Tips to Make Japanese Rice in the Instant Pot](#h-5-most-important-tips-to-make-japanese-rice-in-the-instant-pot)\n*   [How to Store Cooked Rice](#toc-how-to-store-cooked-rice)\n*   [Final Thoughts](#h-final-thoughts)\n*   [Other Rice Cooking Methods](#toc-other-rice-cooking-methods)\n*   [Recipe Card](#toc-recipe-card)\n*   [Did you make this recipe?](#toc-did-you-make-this-recipe)\n\nThe 3 Dilemmas of Making Rice with the Instant Pot\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nBefore I dive into the Instant Pot rice recipe, I want to explain why it took me so long to share this post. If you’ve followed my blog for a while, you probably know that I’ve had my Instant Pot for some time and love using it to make various dishes.\n\nSo, why haven’t I used my favorite Instant Pot to cook steamed rice? Here’s why I had avoided it until now:\n\n### 1\\. The rice sticks to the bottom of the inner pot.\n\nHaving shiny, slightly sweet, plump, and delicious Japanese rice is a true comfort and luxury for me, so I’m willing to spend a little more on short-grain Japanese rice from Japan (I currently enjoy rice from the Kyushu region). When I heard others mention rice sticking to the pot, I decided I wouldn’t cook my precious rice in the Instant Pot. Not a single grain of rice goes to waste in my house.\n\n### 2\\. The Instant Pot is for the main dish.\n\nSince I primarily use the Instant Pot to cook main dishes, it’s not feasible to use it for rice at the same time—unless I use two Instant Pots for this purpose.\n\n### 3\\. My Zojirushi rice cooker does an amazing job.\n\nA rice cooker is an essential appliance in Japanese households. My [Zojirushi Induction Heating Rice Cooker](https://amzn.to/2KoAvW4) makes perfect rice every time, and I can even schedule the cooking time so the rice is always ready for dinner. That’s another reason I didn’t feel the need to use my Instant Pot for cooking rice.\n\n![Perfectly cooked rice served in a rice bowl along with miso soup.](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instant-Pot-Rice-III.jpg)\n\nFinally, the Testing\n--------------------\n\nFor the past three years, I’ve received numerous requests from readers wanting to learn how to cook perfect Instant Pot rice. Some of you even wrote me personal emails, which made me feel I had to give it a try. After all, if I could save hundreds of people from wasting their rice, it’s worth the effort.\n\n**Please note:** Different types of rice—such as jasmine, basmati, long-grain, medium-grain, wild, and brown rice—have unique characteristics, so we can’t cook them the same way. The rice I’m using in this recipe is Japanese short-grain rice.\n\nAlso, 1 cup of rice (240 ml) yields roughly two servings or 2⅓ cups of steamed rice.\n\nFor standard steamed rice, we don’t flavor the rice with chicken broth or salt. The only exception is when cooking brown rice, we do add a tiny bit of salt.\n\nI’ve tried two methods:\n\n1.  Manual pressure cooking with different time periods and natural release timing.\n2.  The preset “Rice” mode on the Instant Pot.\n\n![Perfectly cooked rice served in a rice bowl along with miso soup.](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instant-Pot-Rice-VI.jpg)\n\n5 Most Important Tips to Make Japanese Rice in the Instant Pot\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom my experience in cooking Japanese short-grain rice in my Instant Pot (pressure cooker), I learned 5 important tips. Here are my findings:\n\n### 1\\. Soak rice for 20 minutes.\n\n![Instant Pot Rice](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instantpot-Japanese-Steamed-Rice-step-by-step-10.jpg)\n\nAfter you rinsed the rice, I tried both soaking rice and skipping soaking rice prior to cook rice in the Instant Pot. Whether it’s cooked in manual mode or “Rice” mode, when I didn’t soak rice, it did not become tender all the way through.\n\nThis is probably the only difference between cooking other types of rice. I often get asked why we need to soak Japanese short-grain rice. Unlike the other types of rice, Japanese short-grain rice is plump, and it takes time for the moisture to go through. Therefore, we always soak the rice first, giving the dry rice a head start in absorbing moisture.\n\n### 2\\. Drain rice really well.\n\n![Instant Pot Rice](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instantpot-Japanese-Steamed-Rice-step-by-step-15.jpg)\n\nAfter soaking the rice in water, drain the rice into a fine-mesh strainer and make sure that the rice has no excess water left. If you don’t drain it well, you actually end up with more water while cooking the rice.\n\n### 3\\. The ratio of water to rice is 1 to 1.\n\n![Instant Pot Rice](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instantpot-Japanese-Steamed-Rice-step-by-step-17.jpg)\n\nThe golden rule for the ratio of Japanese short-grain rice to water is **1 to 1.1 or 1.2**. So for 1 _rice cooker_ cup (180 ml, 150 g), you will need 200 ml water.\n\nHowever, **when the rice is cooked in the Instant Pot**, the steam does not escape from the pressure cooking (less evaporation). Therefore, the best water ratio is **one to one:** 1 cup of rice to 1 cup of water, or 1 _rice cooker_ cup (180 ml) of rice to 180 ml of water.\n\n![Instant Pot Rice](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instantpot-Japanese-Steamed-Rice-step-by-step-22.jpg)\n\n### 4\\. Cook at high pressure for 2 minutes.\n\nAfter testing a few different variations, the best cooking time for short-grain rice is 2 minutes on high pressure. I’ve also tried using the “Rice” mode on the Instant Pot, which is set to 12 minutes on low pressure. As both manual and “Rice” mode takes 5 minutes to pressurize, “Rice” mode takes an extra 10 minutes to cook.\n\n### 5\\. Natural release for 10 minutes and then release the pressure.\n\n![Instant Pot Rice](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instantpot-Japanese-Steamed-Rice-step-by-step-23.jpg)\n\nBecause we do not want a “mushy” texture for rice, we must release the pressure from the Instant Pot after 10 minutes. The rice is still being cooked during this natural pressure release stage, but 10 minutes is plenty of time for the rice to finish cooking. After 10 minutes, there is not much pressure left, so you don’t need to worry about releasing the pressure. Don’t forget to fluff the rice with a rice paddle or fork.\n\n![Perfectly cooked rice served in a rice bowl along with miso soup.](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instant-Pot-Rice-V.jpg)\n\nHow to Store Cooked Rice\n------------------------\n\nWhat’s the best method to store cooked rice? Simply freeze the rice in an airtight container and reheat it to enjoy the perfect Instant Pot Rice later on! This is by far the best approach to keeping your rice fresh and moist. Do not keep it in the fridge!\n\n![How to Store Cooked Rice | Easy Japanese Recipes at JustOneCookbook.com](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/How-to-Store-Cooked-Rice-8614.jpg)\n\n[How to Store Cooked Rice](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-freeze-rice/)\n\nFinal Thoughts\n--------------\n\nWith the above methods and tips, you can make perfectly plump and shiny Japanese steamed rice in an Instant Pot. My personal preference is using the manual mode as it’s 10 minutes faster than the “Rice” mode and the texture of the rice was perfect.\n\nDoes the rice stick to the bottom of the pot? Well, surprisingly not when you open the lid right after 10 minutes of natural release. I can fluff up the rice nicely without any question.\n\n![Instant Pot Rice ](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instant-Pot-Rice-VII.jpg)\n\nThe only caveat is that you do have to serve or scoop out the whole pot of rice immediately after it is done cooking. There is enough moisture inside the pot that you can fluff and spoon out the rice smoothly without it sticking to the bottom.\n\nHowever, if you leave the rice inside the inner pot for some time, the rice sadly sticks due to the starch in the rice. And it’s become a hassle to remove the remnants of cooked rice. You would end up having to soak the inner pot in water. It does come off clean eventually, but there is no way I could save the last piece of rice in the Instant Pot (_Update:_ if you buy this [non-stick inner pot](https://amzn.to/2BooQ6P), no more waste!).\n\n![Instant Pot Rice ](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instant-Pot-Rice-IV.jpg)\n\nWould I continue to make rice in the Instant Pot? I would not, because I really don’t like wasting my rice. I prefer to cook the main dish in the Instant Pot and cook rice in the rice cooker. Two important appliances that could go hand in hand.\n\nFor those of you who are preparing main dishes with other cooking methods like roasting and pan-frying. you can definitely cook your rice in the Instant Pot. Maybe you don’t cook rice very often and prefer not to invest in a rice cooker. Or maybe you’re cooking a large batch of rice in advance for freezing purposes. Then go ahead to use the Instant Pot. That’s what this post is for, and I hope you find it useful.\n\n**_Will you cook rice in the Instant Pot?

Please read the blog post for more details. To cook short-grain brown rice, see my post on [How to Cook Brown Rice in an Instant Pot](https://www.justonecookbook.com/instant-pot-brown-rice/).\n    \n    Also note that **1½ cups (300 g, 2** _**rice cooker**_ **cups) of uncooked Japanese short-grain rice** yield 4⅓ cups (660 g) of cooked rice. This is enough for **4 Japanese rice bowls** (typically 150 g each) or **6 onigiri rice balls** (typically 110 g each). 1 cup of cooked rice weighs about 5.3 oz (150 g).\n    \n*   Measure the Rice: Overfill a US cup measure (a ¾-cup measure works well for this) or a rice cooker cup with uncooked short-grain rice and level it off. Put the rice in a large bowl. Repeat until you have the measured amount of rice needed. Here, I‘m preparing 1½ cups (2 _rice cooker_ cups, 360 ml) of uncooked white rice.\n    \n\n#### To Wash the Rice\n\n*   Quick Rinse: Add just enough tap water to the bowl to submerge all the rice. Then, discard the water _**immediately.**_ **Repeat one more time.** **Tip:** Rice absorbs water very quickly when you start rinsing, so this step helps remove impurities from the rice and prevent it from absorbing the first few rounds of milky water.\n    \n    ![Instant Pot Rice 1](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instant-Pot-Rice-1-600x202.jpg)\n    \n*   Wash: Next, use your fingers to gently agitate the wet rice grains in a circular motion for 10–15 seconds. Using very little water allows the grains to rub against each other. It also reduces the absorption of impurities from the starchy water.\n    \n    ![Instant Pot Rice 2](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instant-Pot-Rice-2-600x202.jpg)\n    \n*   Rinse: Add tap water and immediately discard the cloudy water. **Repeat one more time.**\n    \n    ![Instant Pot Rice 3](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instant-Pot-Rice-3-600x202.jpg)\n    \n*   **Repeat** Wash and Rinse (steps 2 and 3) **two more times**. When the water is almost clear, drain the rice well.\n    \n\n#### To Soak the Rice\n\n*   Soak: Add more tap water to the bowl to submerge the rice completely, and soak the rice for 20–30 minutes before cooking. Soaking is a must for short-grain rice! Here‘s how the rice looks before and after soaking for 20 minutes.\n    \n    ![Instant Pot Rice 4](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instant-Pot-Rice-4-600x202.jpg)\n    \n*   Drain: After soaking, drain the rice in a fine-mesh sieve and set it aside for 10 minutes to drain completely. If you don’t have time to wait, then shake off the excess water the best you can.\n    \n    ![Instant Pot Rice 5](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instant-Pot-Rice-5-600x202.jpg)\n    \n\n#### To Cook the Rice\n\n*   Transfer the well-drained rice to the inner pot of the Instant Pot and add the measured water. Here, I'm adding 1½ cups (360 ml) water for my 1½ cups rice.\n    \n    ![Instant Pot Rice 6](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instant-Pot-Rice-6-600x202.jpg)\n    \n*   Make sure the rice is level and evenly distributed in the pot. Close and lock the lid.\n    \n    ![Instant Pot Rice 7](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instant-Pot-Rice-7-600x202.jpg)\n    \n*   Set the program to High Pressure for **2 minutes** and it will automatically start cooking. Make sure the steam release handle points to Sealing and not Venting. The float valve goes up when pressurized, after about 5 minutes. When it’s finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the Keep Warm mode.\n    \n    Pressure Release: Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes. **DO NOT EXCEED 10 MINUTES** (I recommend setting a timer). After 10 minutes, quick release the remaining pressure: Place a kitchen towel over the steam release valve and turn the steam release handle to the Venting position until the float valve drops down. While only a little pressure should remain after **10 minutes** of natural release, please take care not to place your hand or face over the steam release valve.\n    \n    ![Instant Pot Rice 8](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instant-Pot-Rice-8-600x202.jpg)\n    \n*   Once you‘ve quick released the remaining pressure, open the lid. Fluff the rice with a rice paddle and serve warm.\n    \n    ![Instant Pot Rice 9](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Instant-Pot-Rice-9-600x202.jpg)\n    \n\n#### To Store\n\n*   Transfer the warm rice to airtight containers and cover with the lids to keep the moisture in. Let cool completely before storing the containers in the freezer. The best way to store Japanese rice is to freeze, even if you use it the following day. Read [my tutorial post](https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-freeze-rice/).\n    \n    ![Glass airtight containers with steamed rice in them.](https://www.justonecookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/How-to-Store-Cooked-Rice-8582-I-2.jpg)\n    \n\n**Rice Mode vs. Manual Mode**\n\n*   **Rice Mode:** 5 min (to pressurize) + 12 min (to cook on low pressure) + 10 min (let it steam)\n*   **Manual Mode:** 5 min (to pressurize) + 2 min (to cook on high pressure) + 10 min (let it steam) \n\nCalories: 269kcal, Carbohydrates: 59g, Protein: 5g, Fat: 1g, Saturated Fat: 1g, Sodium: 2mg, Potassium: 57mg, Fiber: 2g, Calcium: 15mg, Iron: 3mg\n\nDid you make this recipe?\n-------------------------\n\nTag [@justonecookbook](https://www.instagram.com/justonecookbook/) on Instagram so we can see your delicious creation!",

I ran into the room to find my 3-year-old daughter Valentine buried under the dresser. The scariest moment as a parent, right?? She is okay, just a scrape and maybe some light emotional scarring. Just kidding! I’m sure she will forget about it soon, I hope?? Eric has since bolted the dresser to the wall. There are so many things to feel anxious or guilty about as a parent, but not having the dresser bolted wasn’t even on the list!\n\nI’ve spent the last couple days reading my mom’s journal from when she was about my age: she had just had her fifth baby (me!) and I’ve just had my fourth, and our days are spent corralling children. It’s actually not a journal, it’s a bunch of letters sent to her best friend, who had just moved far away. Because let’s be real, moms with 4 or 5 kids don’t have time to journal!\n\n![Greek gyro with meat, tzatziki sauce, tomato, cucumber, fresh dill, and red onions in a pita. ](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Greek-Gyro-Recipe-7-e1582318228384.jpg \"Greek Gyro Recipe with Homemade Gyro Meat from The Food Charlatan.

I guess motherhood is motherhood, right? If we went back 500 years would it read the same? My mom just finished telling the story about how she was carrying a pot of boiling potatoes to the sink to drain it, and ran into my brother, who was 4. Can you imagine accidentally spilling boiling water all over your son?? Gah! It makes me feel a little better about not having the dresser bolted.\n\nHere are a few excerpts from her letters, in italics. You moms will be able to relate:\n\n_Yesterday I got in a huge fight with my oldest, took away $5 that I owed him, and now I can’t remember the slightest detail.  This led, of course, to the conclusion that I’m a worthless, inconsistent parent prone to hysterics.  So what else is new, huh?_ (“Prone to hysterics” sounds familiar.

Ha!)\n\nWell, there you have it. Me, basically, if I had been a mom in 1987. Oh how history repeats itself!\n\nGyros made easier\n-----------------\n\nMaking traditional gyro meat is both time-consuming and labor intensive. This gyro recipe is essentially a meatloaf made with traditional Greek spices. You get all of the classic flavors without all the prep! And for most of us, it’s also easier than trying to find a food truck that serves these babies. If you live near a gyro truck and can just order them on a whim…I am so jealous!\n\nWhat is gyro meat?\n------------------\n\nGyro meat is a delicious Greek preparation of heavily seasoned ground meat. The meat may be beef, lamb, pork, or some combination of the above. It’s traditionally cooked on a rotisserie (the vertical kind that you may have seen food truck vendors cut thin slices from), but today we’re going to make it in the oven. Fun fact, the word “gyro” actually comes from a Greek word meaning “turn” because of the way that the meat is cooked on a turning spit. And today I’m gonna turn you into a gyro lover (see what I did there?).\n\n### What is gyro meat made of?\n\nThe gyro meat that you will find in most Greek restaurants in the United States is made with a combination of beef and lamb. I’ve never been to Greece, but I’ve read that it is actually more common to see gyros made with pork in the homeland.\n\nToday’s recipe is an easier version of the beef and lamb combo you will see in the US. To make it the way the restaurants do, you have to grind the meat very finely using a meat grinder or food processor, then press it down so that there are no air pockets, and let it marinate for a while. Then they skewer it onto a rotisserie skewer and cook. The meat is sliced off the edges.\n\nIt’s delicious, obviously, but ain’t nobody got time for that. Instead, we are taking all the flavors you love and basically making meatloaf. It takes about 30 minutes to make the meat, start to finish. Ground beef is combined with ground lamb and spiced with cumin, oregano, thyme, rosemary, and marjoram. The resulting meatloaf is tender and flavorful and perfect for a weeknight gyro fest! It comes together pretty quick.\n\nGreek gyro ingredients\n----------------------\n\nToday we are talking GYROS. (pronounced “hero.”) If you have never had a Greek gyro before, you are totally missing out. It is a warm pita bread, topped with lemony-garlicky [Tzatziki Sauce](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/tzatziki-sauce-recipe/), gyro meat, onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers.\n\nIn other words, HEAVEN. Seriously my favorite item to get anytime there is a food truck situation. In Greece they serve it with french fries in the pita itself instead of served on the side. It is now my life mission to make it to Greece someday to try it that way for myself!!\n\nHere are all the ingredients you’ll need to make these–this is just to help you create your shopping list. Keep scrolling down to the recipe card below for full instructions!\n\n**For the gyro meat:**\n\n*   Ground beef\n*   Ground lamb\n*   Bacon grease (or butter)\n*   Eggs\n*   Milk\n*   Lemon juice\n*   Panko bread crumbs\n*   Kosher salt (not table salt!)\n\n*   Onion\n*   Garlic\n*   Dried rosemary\n*   Dried oregano\n*   Dried thyme\n*   Dried cumin\n*   Dried marjoram (optional)\n\n**To assemble:**\n\n*   [**Tzatziki sauce**](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/tzatziki-sauce-recipe/)\n*   Red onion\n*   Tomatoes\n\n*   Cucumbers\n*   Pita bread\n*   Fresh dill (to garnish, optional) \n\nHow to make gyro meat\n---------------------\n\nHere’s a quick overview of how to make these; [jump to the recipe](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/greek-gyro-recipe/#wprm-recipe-container-29201) for complete detailed instructions!\n\nYou’ll start your gyro meat by finely chopping the onion and garlic. Combine both of those in a bowl with ground beef and lamb, butter or bacon grease, eggs, milk, lemon juice, breadcrumbs, and seasonings, including kosher salt. It’s super important to use kosher salt, not table salt, or your meat will be way too salty. (If you only have table salt, use 3 teaspoons instead of 4). Mix it all up using your hands, or, if you prefer a smoother texture, a food processor, then shape the meat for baking.\n\n![ground pork meat ingredients in a bowl on a cutting board.](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Greek-Gyro-Recipe-2-e1582318104988.jpg \"Greek Gyro Recipe with Homemade Gyro Meat from The Food Charlatan.

You could easily shape it into one meatloaf if you prefer, and slice to serve. You will just have to cook it a bit longer.\n\n![roasted greek gyro meat.](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Greek-Gyro-Recipe-8-e1582318248790.jpg \"Greek Gyro Recipe with Homemade Gyro Meat from The Food Charlatan.

I know it can be tricky to find sometimes. If you can’t find ground lamb, you could substitute ground beef or ground pork, but the flavor won’t be the same. Go to your local butcher to find ground lamb, if your market doesn’t have it!\n\nHow to make gyros\n-----------------\n\nWith the meat prepped and ready to go, it’s time to start assembling our gyros. Is your mouth watering yet? (The recipe card below has more details on putting these together.)\n\n*   **Top and serve.** Top the meat off with all your toppings and a sprinkle of fresh dill.\n*   **Prep the toppings:** First thing’s first, get all of your toppings ready to go. I love to slice up red onion, tomatoes, and cucumbers. I also like to toast my bread ever so slightly so it’s nice and warm. You can do this either in the microwave or in the oven.\n*   **Slather on the sauce.** Lay the warm pita out onto a plate or work surface, then slather it with a generous layer of [Tzatziki Sauce](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/tzatziki-sauce-recipe/). \n*   **Add the meat.** Slice one of your prepared gyro patties in half, then lay it on top of the sauce. \n\n![Greek gyro with meat, tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, and fresh dill in a pita. ](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Greek-Gyro-Recipe-4-e1582318124743.jpg \"Greek Gyro Recipe with Homemade Gyro Meat from The Food Charlatan.

The longer the sauce sits, the more flavorful it gets. Prep it ahead of time!\n*   **Line the baking sheet.** You can line the baking sheet with parchment paper or with foil greased with a nonstick spray. This helps prevent the patties from sticking as they bake.\n*   **Use your hands**. I like to wear disposable gloves to mix the meat with my hands. It might feel weird, but it makes mixing so much easier and faster. \n*   **Don’t over-mix**. Over-mixed meat can become tough and dry. Mix only until just combined so it stays moist and tender.\n\nHow to store and reheat this gyro recipe\n----------------------------------------\n\nOnce your gyro is fully assembled, you should definitely serve it right away. However, you can prep the different components ahead of time, so they’re ready to go whenever the gyro mood strikes. Here’s how:\n\n*   **Veggies**: Slice the veggies up and store them in an airtight container in the fridge for 2-3 days.\n*   **[Tzatziki Sauce](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/tzatziki-sauce-recipe/)**: Make the sauce in advance and store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.\n*   **Gyro meat**: Prep and cook the meat, then store it in an airtight container in the fridge for 2-3 days or in the freezer for 2-3 months. To reheat, thaw in the fridge if frozen, then warm in the oven until heated through. If you like, you can slice the meat before freezing so you can pull out just the amount you want at any time.\n*   **Pita bread**: Pita bread can be kept on the counter for 2-3 days, or you can freeze it for 2-3 months and just warm it up in the microwave whenever you like.\n\nServing gyros\n-------------\n\nGyros are traditionally served on pita bread. Pita is a thick, soft, delicious flatbread and makes a great sandwich filled with gyro meat and toppings. You can find pita bread at most grocery stores.\n\nGyros are also often served with seasoned French fries, which is absolutely delicious! If you don’t feel like making french fries, you could serve these gyros with these easy [3 Ingredient Roasted Potatoes](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/3-ingredient-roasted-potatoes-with-crunchy-onions-recipe/). You could also make this [Greek Salad with Feta](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/greek-salad-recipe/) as a refreshing side dish!\n\nGreek gyro recipe FAQ\n---------------------\n\n**How to say Gyro**\n\nGyro is actually pronounced completely differently than it probably looks to most of us. If you say it properly, you’ll be saying “Yee-ro” or “Yee-ros”. So yes, it sounds more like a European currency than a food. But if you’re saying it “hero” or even “jy-ro” believe me I am not here to judge.\n\n**Is gyro meat lamb or pork?**\n\nIt’s both! Or either. Or neither. Traditional gyros are made using a combination of lamb and pork. Some are made using one or the other. Some are even made using other meats entirely like chicken or beef. It’s more about the seasonings anyway.\n\n**What kind of meats are in a gyro?**\n\nGyro meat isn’t a special cut of meat – it’s actually made from ground meat, which comes from a variety of cuts of beef or lamb (or from pork shoulder for ground pork). Sometimes, your ground beef might be labeled “ground round,” “ground sirloin,” or “ground chuck,” but any ground beef is perfectly fine. \n\n**What are the fillers in gyro meat?**\n\nGyro meat includes eggs, milk, lemon juice, breadcrumbs, onion, and garlic to give it flavor and moistness.What else? Seasonings, seasonings, and more seasonings! We’re using a combination of salt, pepper, dried oregano, rosemary, thyme, cumin, and marjoram.\n\n**What does a gyro consist of?**\n\nA gyro is a warm pita bread, topped with lemony-garlicky [Tzatziki Sauce](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/tzatziki-sauce-recipe/), gyro meat, onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers. It’s the ultimate Greek sandwich. Gyro meat itself is a Greek preparation of heavily seasoned ground meat. The meat may be beef, lamb, pork, or some combination of the above. I’ve never had a combination I didn’t like, it’s all about the seasonings! \n\n**Why is gyro meat called gyro?**\n\nThe word gyro comes from a Greek word which means “circle” or “turn.” It makes sense because gyro meat is usually cooked on a rotisserie. Ever watched a rotisserie chicken spin around at Costco? There’s a spit (a large, heavy metal skewer in the middle of the meat) that turns the meat around in a circular motion to cook it evenly. \n\n### More Greek recipes you will enjoy!\n\n*   [Gyro Style Shredded Beef (Instant Pot/Crock Pot)](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/gyro-style-shredded-beef/) >> This recipe for shredded beef is another great idea for filling gyros!

Top with_ _Tzatziki Sauce__, tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers!_\n\n#### For the gyro meat\n\n*   ▢ 1 pound ground beef\n*   ▢ 1 pound ground lamb\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons bacon grease , OR butter\\*\n*   ▢ 2 large eggs\n*   ▢ 1/2 cup milk\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons lemon juice\n*   ▢ 1 cup Panko bread crumbs\n*   ▢ 1 medium onion, finely chopped\n*   ▢ 6 cloves garlic, smashed and finely minced\n*   ▢ 4 teaspoons kosher salt, yes, 4 teaspoons\\*\\*\n*   ▢ 2 teaspoons black pepper\n*   ▢ 2 teaspoons dried oregano\n*   ▢ 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon dried thyme\n*   ▢ 2 teaspoons dried cumin\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon dried marjoram, optional\n\n#### To assemble\n\n*   ▢ 1 batch [Tzatziki Sauce](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/tzatziki-sauce-recipe/)\n*   ▢ 1 large red onion, sliced thin\n*   ▢ 2-4 tomatoes, sliced\n*   ▢ 1-2 cucumbers, sliced\n*   ▢ 8-10 pita rounds\n*   ▢ fresh dill, to garnish, optional\n\n*   **Start by making the [Tzatziki Sauce](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/tzatziki-sauce-recipe/).** It needs time to marinate, so get it done first so it can sit in the fridge while you make the rest.\n    \n*   **Make the gyro meat.** Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line [a rimmed baking sheet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049C2S32/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=karen0ad-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0049C2S32&linkId=7a7e990557b07b3e50b558c557362453) with parchment paper. Or line with foil and spray with nonstick spray.\n    \n*   If you have a food processor, use it to finely chop the onion and garlic. If not, use a knife to chop finely.\n    \n*   In a large bowl, add all gyro meat ingredients: 1 pound ground beef, 1 pound ground lamb, 2 tablespoons butter OR bacon grease,\\* 2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 cup Panko crumbs, chopped onion, minced garlic, 4 teaspoons **kosher salt** (see note), 2 teaspoons black pepper, 2 teaspoons oregano, 1/2 teaspoon rosemary, 1 teaspoon thyme, 2 teaspoons cumin, 1 teaspoon marjoram. (It’s ok if you don’t have the marjoram.)\n    \n*   Combine the meat using your hands. I like to [wear disposable gloves](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N1TY8DJ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=karen0ad-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07N1TY8DJ&linkId=c70ecf9e060de796b423b8ba860a0b0c) when I do this. Using your hands feels a little weird, but it mixes the meat so much faster and more evenly than using a spoon, resulting in nice tender meat (as opposed to being overworked.)\n    \n*   Shape the meat into about 10 oval patties. See photos. Line them up on the pan making sure they are not touching each other.\n    \n*   Bake at 350 for about 15-20 minutes, or until [a meat thermometer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IHHLB3W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=karen0ad-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01IHHLB3W&linkId=5cee52d153b1817b8b6d373fe09f8d17) reaches 160 degrees F. Remove from the oven and keep warm.\n    \n*   **Meanwhile, prepare the gyro toppings:** Thinly slice a red onion. Slice the tomatoes. Slice the cucumbers. Warm the pita bread either in the microwave or in the still-warm oven. Chop extra fresh dill, if you want.\n    \n*   **How to construct your gyro**: Add a layer of [Tzatziki Sauce](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/tzatziki-sauce-recipe/) to a warm pita. Slice a gyro patty in half lengthwise for easier eating, and place on top of Tzatziki. Garnish with red onion, tomatoes, cucumbers, and fresh dill. Devour!\n    \n*   Gyros are traditionally served with french fries, or you could try it with these [3 ingredient Roasted Potatoes.](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/3-ingredient-roasted-potatoes-with-crunchy-onions-recipe/) It would also be great served with this [Greek Salad!](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/greek-salad-recipe/)\n    \n\n\\*I tried this recipe once with butter and once with bacon grease. I added it because lamb is very lean and tends to dry out when baked. You can probably skip it if you have high-fat ground beef. \n\n\\*\\*If you are using table salt, add 3 teaspoons salt. \n\nHow to store and reheat this gyro recipe\n----------------------------------------\n\nOnce your gyro is fully assembled, you should definitely serve it right away. However, you can prep the different components ahead of time, so they’re ready to go whenever the gyro mood strikes. Here’s how:\n\n*   **Veggies**: Slice the veggies up and store them in an airtight container in the fridge for 2-3 days.\n*   **[Tzatziki Sauce](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/tzatziki-sauce-recipe/)**: Make the sauce in advance and store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.\n*   **Gyro meat**: Prep and cook the meat, then store it in an airtight container in the fridge for 2-3 days or in the freezer for 2-3 months. To reheat, thaw in the fridge if frozen, then warm in the oven until heated through. If you like, you can slice the meat before freezing so you can pull out just the amount you want at any time.\n*   **Pita bread**: Pita bread can be kept on the counter for 2-3 days, or you can freeze it for 2-3 months and just warm it up in the microwave whenever you like.\n\nServing: 1gyro | Calories: 718kcal | Carbohydrates: 52g | Protein: 32g | Fat: 43g | Saturated Fat: 15g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 3g | Monounsaturated Fat: 13g | Trans Fat: 1g | Cholesterol: 148mg | Potassium: 602mg | Fiber: 3g | Sugar: 7g | Vitamin A: 693IU | Vitamin C: 10mg | Calcium: 265mg | Iron: 4mg\n\nCourse: Main Course\n\nCuisine: Greek\n\nCalories: 718\n\nKeyword: Greek, gyros\n\nYou May Also Like...\n--------------------",

Am I on the wrong blog? But I can’t help it. I had an unforgettable kale salad last weekend and seeing as my life (and undoubtedly various legal statues) does not allow me to move into [Barbuto](http://www.barbutonyc.com/) (believe me, I’m considering it as I type… would they notice? I’ve always wanted more windows…), I had to attempt to riff on it at home. And if I’m going to be making it at home, well, it seems rude to keep it from you. We have no cooking secrets here.\n\n[![lacinato, tuscan or black kale](https://i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5468/9500873843_f20ae2e9df_z.jpg?w=640)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/9500873843/ \"lacinato, tuscan or black kale\")  \n[![let's chiffonade this](https://i0.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2864/9500874757_6cac8ba3cd_z.jpg?w=640)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/9500874757/ \"let's chiffonade this\")\n\nWe did the Chef’s Table for my husband’s birthday on Saturday night and were this the kind of blog that covered restaurants, this paragraph would be all, _omg it was so good, squee, vegetables!_ and _each dish was better than the one before_ and _they were so generous!_ and you would quickly realize why I don’t. Fortunately, I’m only interested in talking about the parts of great meals outside my kitchen that I can drag back into it, and that brings us to kale.\n\n[![finely slivered kale hay](https://i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5342/9503676024_78d55b01e3_z.jpg?w=640)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/9503676024/ \"finely slivered kale hay\")\n\n[![golden raisins, plumping in vinegar](https://i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3824/9500875681_d6223b2cab_z.jpg?w=640)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/9500875681/ \"golden raisins, plumping in vinegar\")  \n[![toasting the crumbs in olive oil](https://i0.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2868/9503676904_8814e87329_z.jpg?w=640)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/9503676904/ \"toasting the crumbs in olive oil\")  \n[![coarsely chopped walnuts](https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7284/9503677792_0cc3df88c3_z.jpg?w=640)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/9503677792/ \"coarsely chopped walnuts\")  \n[![hello, little romano](https://i0.wp.com/farm3.staticflickr.com/2886/9500877519_7686518c29_z.jpg?w=640)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/9500877519/ \"hello, little romano\")  \n[![pecorino, plumped raisins, walnuts, crumbs, kale](https://i0.wp.com/farm8.staticflickr.com/7304/9500878199_586dd4b701_z.jpg?w=640)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/9500878199/ \"pecorino, plumped raisins, walnuts, crumbs, kale\")  \n[![kale salad with walnuts and pecorino](https://i0.wp.com/farm6.staticflickr.com/5524/9503680750_cd9c59f463_z.jpg?w=640)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/9503680750/ \"kale salad with walnuts and pecorino\")\n\nYes, kale. Look, I came around on kale, I did! I realized that I didn’t dislike _it_ so much as much as I was suspicious of fervor around it, as if there had never been any other healthy vegetables before it, as if it its renaissance was the result of the kind of PR team only a certain troubled mayoral candidate could dream of right now. And [the kale chips of 2010](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2010/03/baked-kale-chips/) didn’t do much to convince me \\[ducks; sends self home from the internet in disgrace\\]. But it turns out, I like kale the way I like my slaws — raw, finely slivered, not overwhelmed by dressing and with just the right extra punches to round it out. Here, they’re golden raisins gently plumped with wine vinegar, deeply toasted walnuts, crunchy breadcrumbs, toasted in olive oil, and an uncompromising volume of salty aged pecorino romano. Both at home and the restaurant, we polished off the kale salad _first_; sheesh, even the resident [3 year-old](http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/9500742721/in/photostream) was curious enough to take a bite (but, predictably, deemed only the raisins acceptable). In my house, that’s considered a home run.\n\n[![last night's blurry dinner](https://i0.wp.com/farm4.staticflickr.com/3830/9500744929_a89557baea_z.jpg?w=640)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/9500744929/ \"last night's blurry dinner\")\n\n##### Video\n\n##### Previously\n\n**One year ago:** [Leek, Chard and Corn Flatbread](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2012/08/leek-chard-and-corn-flatbread/)  \n**Two years ago:** [Peach Butter](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2011/09/peach-butter/)  \n**Three years ago:** [Zucchini Almond Pasta Salad](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2010/08/zucchini-and-almond-pasta-salad/)  \n**Four years ago:** [Roasted Carrot and Avocado Salad](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2009/08/roasted-carrot-and-avocado-salad/)  \n**Five years ago:** [Huevos Rancheros](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2008/07/huevos-rancheros/)  \n**Six years ago:** [Mixed Bean Salad](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2007/08/bean-symphony/)\n\n**Kale Salad with Pecorino and Walnuts**\n\nLike I did on a recent [ice cream cake](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2013/07/hot-fudge-sundae-cake/), please consider this a tale of two recipes, one that’s bare bones (add the raisins, walnuts and crumbs without the extra prep) and one if you’d like to get a little more depth from each. Both work, but the slightly longer prep (toasting the nuts, the crumbs in olive oil, plumping the raisins, etc.) really makes the salad sing and will not be regretted. You can choose your own adventure, too, doing more for some ingredients and less for others.\n\nWe had this with a tortilla de patatas (Spanish potato, egg and olive oil omelet), our first one of the summer, and it was the perfect weeknight dinner. It also reminded me that it was time to update and streamline/simplify my recipe from 2007, which I did. [See it here](http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2007/09/tortilla-de-patatas/).\n\n1/2 cup (55 grams or 2 ounces ounces) walnut halves or pieces  \n1/4 cup (45 grams or 1 1/2 ounces) golden raisins  \n1 tablespoon white wine vinegar  \n1 tablespoon water  \n1/4 cup panko (15 grams or 1/2 ounce) or slightly coarse homemade breadcrumbs (from a thin slice of hearty bread)  \n1 tiny clove garlic, minced or pressed  \nCoarse or kosher salt  \n3 tablespoons olive oil  \n1 bunch (about 14 ounces or 400 grams) tuscan kale (also known as black or lacinato kale; this is the thinner, flatter leaf variety), washed and patted dry  \n2 ounces (55 grams) pecorino cheese, grated or ground in a food processor, which makes it delightfully rubbly (1/2 cup total)  \nJuice of half a lemon  \nFreshly ground black pepper or red pepper flakes, to taste\n\n_Prepare walnuts:_ Heat oven to 350. Toast walnuts on a baking sheet for 10 minutes, tossing once. Let cool and coarsely chop.\n\n_Prepare raisins:_ In a small saucepan over low heat, simmer white wine vinegar, water and raisins for 5 minutes, until plump and soft. Set aside in liquid.\n\n_Prepare crumbs:_ Toast bread crumbs, garlic and 2 teaspoons of the olive oil in a skillet together with a pinch of salt until golden. Set aside.\n\n_Prepare kale:_ Trim heavy stems off kale and remove ribs. I always find removing the ribs annoying with a knife, because the leaves want to roll in on the knife and make it hard to get a clean cut. Instead, I’ve taken to tearing the ribs off with my fingers, which is much easier for me. Stack sections of leaves and roll them into a tube, then cut them into very thin ribbons crosswise.\n\n_Assemble salad:_ Put kale in a large bowl. Add pecorino, walnuts and raisins (leaving any leftover vinegar mixture in dish), remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and lemon juice and toss until all the kale ribbons are coated. Taste and adjust seasonings with salt, pepper and some of the reserved vinegar mixture from the raisins, if needed. Let sit for 10 minutes before serving, if you can, as it helps the ingredients come together. Just before serving, toss with breadcrumbs and, if needed, a final 1 teaspoon drizzle of olive oil.",

Even devoted carnivores can’t deny the gloriousness that is halloumi cheese cooked directly on a grill until it’s got lovely little grill marks, a hint of a crisp outer layer and a milky, creamy, slightly oozy middle. Pop it on top of an arugula salad and dress it all with a creamy, herby basil dressing and, well, it’s hard to think of someone who would actually say “no thank you” to this stunner of a meal. Cherry tomatoes, pickled onions and grilled avocado slices (yes, grilled avocado slices!) round out a salad recipe that’s deeply satisfying and absolutely company-worthy.  \n\n![ingredients for Grilled Halloumi Salad arugula, avocado, tomatoes, pickled onions, basil and panko](https://images.themodernproper.com/production/posts/2021/Grilled-Halloumi-Salad-1.jpeg?w=300&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1623650535&s=4a57f797679665338f694ee78cec318a)\n\nWhat Is Halloumi?\n-----------------\n\nHalloumi cheese is a cheese that originated in Cyprus, and was traditionally enjoyed throughout the Mediterranean. Usually made from goat’s or sheep’s milk—or sometimes a combination of the two—it’s salty and milky, a bit like a saltier, tangier, slightly firmer version of mozzarella. It’s usually served cooked, and most often cooked by grilling, just as we do here in this delicious grilled halloumi salad. Although it’s high in saturated fat, halloumi is a terrific vegetarian source of protein and calcium, and we happen to think that this halloumi salad recipe counts as at least a kinda sorta healthy-ish vegetarian dinner, and it’s certainly healthier for the planet than having, say, a cheese burger. It’s big slabs of grilled cheese! On a salad! It’s the best meatless Monday ever.  \n\n![basil, mayonnaise, sour cream, parsley, Onion powder\n, Garlic powder\n, Dried dill\n, Salt, and basil in a food processor](https://images.themodernproper.com/production/posts/2021/Grilled-Halloumi-Salad-2.jpeg?w=300&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1623650621&s=365da650df222f9261e1e42c3de1ed68)\n\n![creamy basil dressing in a food processor](https://images.themodernproper.com/production/posts/2021/Grilled-Halloumi-Salad-5.jpeg?w=300&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1623650635&s=a5ad24de201039f8b281f1065a0dcf11)\n\nA Few Basic Grilled Halloumi Salad Ingredients\n----------------------------------------------\n\nRich and melty, grilled halloumi cheese is easily the star of this salad recipe. But grilled avocado gives it a run for its money! A little smoky and nicely creamy, it’s a terrific addition. The two together bring a lot of heft, so a generous bed of spicy arugula is the perfect lettuce to contrast and complement all that fatty richness. Pickled red onions bring a little tangy bite to the party, too, and juicy ripe cherry tomatoes root the salad firmly in summertime (just in case all that grilling didn’t already let you know that this is a super summery salad.) As for the butter and panko? You’ll just use a little butter to toast the panko bread crumbs so that they’re extra crispy and ever so slightly warm—an ideal textural lift to a salad that’s seriously splendid. Here’s everything you’ll need to make this halloumi cheese salad recipe:\n\n*   Halloumi\n    \n*   Avocado\n    \n*   Arugula\n    \n*   Olive oil\n    \n*   Butter\n    \n*   Panko\n    \n*   Cherry tomatoes\n    \n*   Pickled onions\n    \n\n![panko bread crumbs toasted in butter in a skillet](https://images.themodernproper.com/production/posts/2021/Grilled-Halloumi-Salad-3.jpeg?w=300&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1623650664&s=a4acd39f59311b9f10060b5bd722735f)\n\n![Grilled halloumi and grilled avocado on a grill pan](https://images.themodernproper.com/production/posts/2021/Grilled-Halloumi-Salad-4.jpeg?w=300&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1623650691&s=67160a29b768b4a0380dc2ca7464006d)\n\nA Creamy, Basil-y, Halloumi Salad Dressing Recipe\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nA fabulous salad calls for an equally stand-out salad dressing, and this rich and creamy basil dressing really fits the bill. You know that stuff we said earlier about this halloumi salad being healthy-ish? Well, with mayo AND sour cream in the halloumi salad dressing, we’d better go ahead and say that this recipe is healthy-ish with a heavy emphasis on _ish_. But there’s still lettuce at play, so that’s good, right? Anyway, to make this super delicious, slightly ranch-ish basil salad dressing, simply blend together:\n\n*    Mayonnaise \n    \n*   Sour cream \n    \n*   Fresh basil\n    \n*   Parsley\n    \n*   Dill\n    \n*   Onion powder \n    \n*   Garlic powder \n    \n\n![Grilled Halloumi Salad with arugula, pickled onions, avocado, tomatoes and creamy basil dressing](https://images.themodernproper.com/production/posts/2021/Grilled-Halloumi-Salad-7.jpeg?w=300&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1623650749&s=685c3234cd2ec9c37da6200d0d417276)\n\nHow To Make A Gorgeous Grilled Avocado and Halloumi Salad\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are a lot of little elements to this salad recipe—the grilling, the toasting, the dressing-making—but none of them are hard or fussy, and you can just take it one step at a time. It also doesn’t require any special kitchen tools or fiddly techniques. Just a little time and attention to yield a truly elegant, indulgent grilled halloumi salad. Here’s how to make it:\n\n1.  Fire up the grill!\n    \n2.  Brush the halloumi and avocado slices with olive oil.\n    \n3.  Grill the halloumi and avocado just until they get grill marks—a couple of minutes per side. They don’t actually _need_ to be cooked, grilling just adds a nice smoky flavor and gets the cheese melting a bit, so you get to take a break from worrying about reaching a particular internal temp.\n    \n4.  Make the basil dressing!\n    \n5.  Toast the panko in a bit of butter until it’s crisp and golden brown.\n    \n6.  Assemble the grilled halloumi salad and serve right away, while the cheese is warm and slightly oozy.\n    \n\n![Grilled Halloumi Salad with arugula, pickled onions, avocado, tomatoes and creamy basil dressing](https://images.themodernproper.com/production/posts/2021/Grilled-Halloumi-Salad-8.jpeg?w=300&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1623650782&s=fb237b7c3b6cd60d051ce8f006e87fe2)\n\n![Grilled Halloumi Salad with arugula, pickled onions, avocado, tomatoes and creamy basil dressing](https://images.themodernproper.com/production/posts/2021/Grilled-Halloumi-Salad-9.jpeg?w=300&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1623650800&s=97f984cd478e379e7fa654f97d7472f8)\n\n![Grilled halloumi Salad with avocado, pickled onions, arugula and cherry tomatoes with a creamy basil dressing](https://images.themodernproper.com/production/posts/2021/Grilled-Halloumi-Salad-10.jpeg?w=300&q=82&auto=format&fit=crop&dm=1623650805&s=ceda6d93203b2c17ead6299d82c7c355)\n\nGrilling Night + Salad Night + Meatless Mondays!\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you make this stunning grilled halloumi salad, be sure to share a photo and tag us on Instagram using [@themodernproper](https://www.instagram.com/themodernproper/) and [#themodernproper](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/themodernproper/) so that we can see your stuff!

Smashing some of the beans to release their starch will give you a thicker soup that’s almost worthy of a fork. To keep it on the brothy side, add a little more liquid and leave the beans intact.

Step\n    \n    1\n    \n    Heat a large pot over medium-high for a minute or so to warm it up. Add the oil and heat until it thins out, about 30 seconds. Add onion and carrot, and sauté until very soft and brown at the edges, 7 to 10 minutes.\n    \n2.  Step\n    \n    2\n    \n    Meanwhile, rinse the greens and pull the leaves off the stems. Tear or chop into bite-size pieces and set aside.\n    \n3.  Step\n    \n    3\n    \n    When the onion is golden, add tomato paste, ¾ teaspoon cumin and ⅛ teaspoon red-pepper flakes to the pot, and sauté until paste darkens, about 1 minute. Add turkey, garlic, ginger and 1 teaspoon salt, and sauté, breaking up the meat with your spoon, until turkey is browned in spots, 4 to 7 minutes.\n    \n4.  Step\n    \n    4\n    \n    Add stock and beans, and bring to a simmer. Let simmer until the soup is thick and flavorful, adding more salt if needed, 15 to 25 minutes. If you like a thicker broth, you can smash some of the beans with the back of the spoon to release their starch. Or leave the beans whole for a brothier soup.\n    \n5.  Step\n    \n    5\n    \n    Add the greens to the pot and simmer until they are very soft. This will take 5 to 10 minutes for most greens, but tough collard greens might take 15 minutes. (Add a little water if the broth gets too reduced.)\n    \n6.  Step\n    \n    6\n    \n    Stir herbs and lemon juice into the pot, taste and add more salt, cumin and lemon until the broth is lively and bright-tasting. Serve topped with a drizzle of olive oil and more red-pepper flakes, if desired.\n    \n\nPrivate Notes\n\nLeave a Private Comment on this recipe and see it here.\n\n5\n\nout of 5\n\n19,709\n\nuser ratings\n\nor to rate this recipe.\n\nHave you cooked this?\n\nor to mark this recipe as cooked.\n\nYou never need to be without that pesky \"1 Tbsp. of tomato paste.\" Open a can at both ends and remove the lid from one end. Using the other lid, push out approximately a tablespoonful of paste, slice it off and lay it on a sheet of waxed paper on a small cutting board or flat tray; repeat until you've used it all. Place the rounds of paste in the freezer and, when frozen solid, store in a zipper bag with the air sucked out. Voila, small portions of tomato paste on demand.\n\nI'm always confused by \"bunch of greens.\" One store near me sells a bundle of kale that will feed 2 or 3 people when cooked, while another store sells bunches large enough to feed 5 or 6. It would be clearer if recipes used a different measuring system, like how many leaves or cups of chopped greens.\n\nI don’t throw away the tasty stalks of the greens, whether those be kale, collard or what ever I might have on hand. Instead, after stripping the leaves, I dice the stalks into 1/4” bits and sauté them with the onion. The extra cooking time renders them soft and they add to the overall flavor of the dish.\n\nDelicious, easy and inexpensive with nearly all pantry ingredients. Made as directed except instead of greens let my family put baby spinach in their soup bowls and ladle hot soup over it, which is good for picky palates. I was a little skeptical about the flavor combinations but it really was delicious. I was heavy handed with the ginger and used parsley and used a pound of turkey since that was the smallest size at the grocery store. Perfect for a cold day.\n\nI followed the recipe, using tarragon as the herb and a full head of kale (sans big vein, leaves cut into tiny short strips) and mashed some of the white beans. At the end I added a bit of smoked paprika, an extra can of chickpeas and a a few cups of cooked blended brown and black rice to create a complete protein and additional fiber. It has been a SMASH! What a great twist on this chili like dish.\n\nI added lemon zest to amp up the lemon flavor. The beans might retain better texture if added later in the process.\n\nPrivate comments are only visible to you.",

Can you substitute onions? Yes! However keep in mind that shallots are more delicate in flavor, a bit sweeter and less intense than regular onion.\n*   **Garlic**\\- minced.\n*   **Baby Bella Mushrooms**\\- baby bella mushrooms are earthier and meatier than white button mushrooms, making them a perfect pairing with richer flavors.\n*   **Beef Broth**\\- beef broth has a strong, rich, robust flavor making it a great match for mushrooms. If you'd like to make this vegetarian, you can substitute vegetable broth.\n*   **White Wine**\\- this is important! White wine adds acidity to the soup which really brings out the flavors. If you'd like to substitute the wine, try a splash of white wine vinegar instead.\n*   **Worcestershire Sauce**\\- to deepen the flavor.\n*   **Spices-** Salt, pepper, dried dill, paprika, and dried thyme\n*   **Pearl Couscous or Israeli Couscous**\\- Pearl couscous is much bigger than regular couscous with a soft, chewy mouth feel. They are very hearty, perfect for a cozy soup or stew. If you are unable to pearl couscous, it can be substituted with a small pasta such as orzo or ditalini.\n*   **Half and Half**\\- half and half is a mixture of half whole milk and half cream, and can be found in the coffee creamer section of most grocery stores. It's lighter and has less fat than regular cream.\n*   **Sour cream**\\- for garnish and a nice contrast to the robust flavors of the soup.\n*   **Crusty Bread**\\- for serving\n\nHow To Make Soup Vegetarian:\n----------------------------\n\nFor vegetarian soup, substitute beef broth with vegetable broth. To make vegan, replace butter with olive oil. Coconut milk can be used in place of half & half. It will give your soup a bit more sweetness, but is a nice contrast to the more savory flavors.\n\nHow to Serve Creamy Mushroom & Couscous Soup:\n---------------------------------------------\n\n*   This soup is hearty enough to be eaten on it's own, but crusty bread is always a good idea!\n\n![Mushroom Soup- Must Love Garlic](https://must-love-garlic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/creamy-mushroom-pearl-couscous-soup-3-683x1024.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Mushroom Soup:\n--------------------------\n\n*   **Cook Vegetables**: Add butter to a large pot over medium heat. Allow to melt, but not brown. Add sliced baby bella mushroom, minced shallot, & minced garlic to pot. Cook and stir for 2 minutes until aromatic.\n\n*   **Add Seasoning, Broth, and Couscous**: Sprinkle dried dill, dried thyme, and paprika into pot and stir. Whisk in Worcestershire sauce, white wine, and beef broth. Taste and season with salt & pepper. Bring pot to a boil, pour in couscous, and cover pot with a lid.

Soup will keep for **2-3 days**. If you would like to freeze soup, make and freeze the soup base only (stop recipe before adding pearl couscous & cream). The soup base will last in the freezer for up to 3 months. Once ready to cook, allow to thaw, add to large pot and continue with recipe.\n\n*   **Reheat**\\-reheat soup in a saucepan over low heat.

You can unsubscribe anytime. Have an account? Log In.\n\nWhy You’ll Love this Winter Salad Recipe\n----------------------------------------\n\n*   **Make Ahead Friendly**. Because kale is a heartier green than spinach, kale salads can be dressed hours in advance without wilting; in fact, the longer this salad sits, the better it gets. (The same is true of this [Winter Slaw](https://www.wellplated.com/winter-slaw/).) Bonus points, this easy winter salad won’t occupy any space on your stovetop or oven, both of which are prime territory during a holiday meal.\n*   **Healthy Holiday Side**. Kale salad is just not the sort of dish that garners the instant appreciation that’s showered upon [Cheesy Scalloped Potatoes](https://www.wellplated.com/homemade-scalloped-potatoes-recipe/), but that doesn’t mean you don’t need it! It’s a bright counterpoint to all of the [Mulled Wine](https://www.wellplated.com/spiced-wine/) and [Glazed Sweet Potatoes](https://www.wellplated.com/glazed-sweet-potatoes/).\n*   **Beautiful Flavor Combo**. Like my other favorite holiday salads, [Beet Salad](https://www.wellplated.com/beet-salad/), [Apple Walnut Salad](https://www.wellplated.com/apple-walnut-salad/) and the Maple Roasted Butternut Squash Salad in _[The Well Plated Cookbook](https://rstyle.me/+nsbT2EsEw4rgJ88CdrE56A)_, the bright, fresh flavors and beautiful colors here can sit proudly alongside even the most cheesy of potato dishes.

Very easy.”\n> \n> — Stefanie —\n\n![Pomegranates cut in half and quarters](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Winter-Pomegranate-Salad-Recipe.jpg)\n\nHow to Make Crisp Winter Salad\n------------------------------\n\nDare to sign up for the salad. This red and green winter salad with kale and pomegranate will give you reason to be proud of your contribution.\n\nIt’s alive with flavor, easy to make, and ultra-festive for Christmas or Thanksgiving.\n\n* * *\n\n### **The Ingredients**\n\n*   **Kale**. While often viewed as an undesirable ingredient, kale gets a chance to shine in this winter salad. It becomes tender once coated in the Dijon dressing, and any bitterness is offset by the sweet pops of pomegranate. Plus, it’s rich in antioxidants and vitamin-K.\n*   **Pecan Halves**. Pecans add a toasty, crunchy element.\n*   **Red Onion**. I love the crisp bite that red onions add to the salad.\n*   **Pomegranate**. These sweet, sour, and juicy little seeds are a delightful addition. They also provide beautiful, festive pops of color, making this salad ideal for a holiday spread.\n\nIngredient Swap\n---------------\n\nThis winter salad is also delicious with pears, apples, or a combination. You can the pears either in addition to or in place of the pomegranate (personally I’d keep both, because the pomegranate is so pretty).\n\n*   **Feta**. Creamy, salty, and cheesy deliciousness. This salad is also delicious with goat cheese or a mild blue cheese.\n\n*   **Winter Salad Dressing**. Olive oil, apple cider vinegar, Dijon mustard, honey, salt, and pepper create the most light, zippy, and delicious dressing that’s strong enough to hold up to the kale.\n\nTo Make Vegan\n-------------\n\nIf you need this to be a vegan winter salad, you can simply omit the feta or swap in a dairy-free feta.\n\n### The Directions\n\n1.  Toast the pecans. Whisk the dressing ingredients together.\n2.  Toss the kale and onion with the dressing. Refrigerate for 20 minutes. Top with pecans, pomegranate, feta, and parsley. DIG IN!\n\nTip!\n----\n\nTo keep the flavor of the red onions but mellow some of their harsh afterbite, soak them in water before adding them to the salad.\n\n![A green salad on a plate with toppings](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Winter-Kale-Pomegranate-Salad.jpg)\n\nWinter Salad Storage Tips\n-------------------------\n\n*   **To Store**.

Log In.\n\n#### For the Winter Salad:\n\n*   ½ cup [pecan halves](https://amzlink.to/az0Ama5SadOJO)\n*   ½ small red onion\n*   10 ounces kale stems removed and chopped into ribbons (if using bagged, pre-cut kale, use 8 ounces)\n*   1 small pomegranate to yield 1/2 cup seeds\n*   4  ounces crumbled feta cheese\n*   2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley\n\n* * *\n\n*   Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the pecans on an ungreased baking sheet in a single layer. Bake for 5-10 minutes, tossing once or twice throughout, until toasted and fragrant. Watch carefully and set a timer so that the nuts do not burn. Remove from the baking sheet and set aside.\n    \n*   Slice the onion thinly and place in a small bowl. Cover with cold tap water and set aside for 10 minutes while you finish preparing the rest of the salad (this will keep the onion’s flavor but prevent the onion from having such a harsh, raw bite.) Drain the onion and lightly pat dry.\n    \n*   Slice the pomegranate in half across its “equator” (NOT top to bottom). Working one half at a time, turn the pomegranate over an empty bowl, cut side down, and squeeze it gently all the way around to loosen the seeds. With the back of a wooden spoon, firmly wrap the back of the pomegranate, knocking the seeds into the bowl (be careful—the juice can splatter). Rotate the pomegranate then repeat, so that you tap it all the way around and knock out as many seeds as possible. Slice the pomegranate into big wedges and remove any seeds you missed with your fingers. Repeat with the second half. Measure out 1/2 cup of the seeds for the recipe, then save the rest for a different use.\n    \n*   In a small bowl or large measuring cup, whisk together all of the dressing ingredients: olive oil, apple cider vinegar, mustard, honey, salt, and pepper. Alternatively, you can shake all of the ingredients together in a tightly sealed mason jar.\n    \n*   Place the kale and onion slices in a large serving bowl. Pour the dressing over the top. Toss to coat, then let the salad rest in the refrigerator for 20 minutes if time allows (the flavors will meld and the kale will become more tender). Just before serving, sprinkle with the toasted pecans, pomegranate seeds, feta, and parsley. Toss lightly and serve.\n    \n\n*   **TO MAKE AHEAD**: Winter salad can be made up to 8 hours in advance (including adding the dressing—in fact, it will be better if you do!). Store in the refrigerator until ready to serve, or set out up to 1 hour in advance.\n\nServing: 1(of 4)Calories: 376kcalCarbohydrates: 27gProtein: 10gFat: 28gSaturated Fat: 7gCholesterol: 25mgPotassium: 619mgFiber: 5gSugar: 15gVitamin A: 7368IUVitamin C: 96mgCalcium: 269mgIron: 2mg\n\nMore Healthy Salad Recipes\n--------------------------\n\nWhether you want a winter pasta salad, winter bean salad, or even a warm winter salad, there’s a recipe here for you!\n\nYou May Also Like\n-----------------\n\n![Avatar photo](https://www.wellplated.com/wp-content/uploads/nsl_avatars/779f867a4148224a57a2f7f031676cf1.jpg)\n\n#### Erin Clarke\n\nHi, I’m Erin Clarke, cookbook author and the home cook behind Well Plated.

In this 20-minute recipe, kale, broccoli and chickpeas crisp under the broiler while the pasta water boils.

First I will broil the Chickpeas apart from the Broccoli and Kale. The Chickpeas require longer under heat to crisp, and that much time will positively cremate the greens. The other small change is to halve the ricotta, 8 ounces was a little much and dulled the flavor of the lemon splashed veggies.\n\nHi guys! We hear you: We read your notes, and we've adjusted the recipe so that the vegetables are cooked on separate pans. The ricotta is also added earlier, so that should help those who had trouble stirring everything together. I hope this helps!\n\nP.S. No One makes 12 oz of dried pasta rather than the entire box of 16 oz. The standard has always been 16 oz feeds four persons as a main course.\n\nPromises more than it delivers. Next time I will sauté lots of thin slivers of garlic, and hold them aside for a topping with flaky sea salt. I will either leave out the delicious kale chips, or just sauté baby kale leaves with the garlic and EVOO. I will - and did - let the ricotta come to room temp before using. I will use a very generous amount of lemon juice which this recipe needs to keep it from tumbling over the Cliff of Blandness. I will also leave more than 20 minutes to cook.\n\nAbsolutely delicious! My personal hacks: No kale on hand. Subbed w/sautéed & seasoned spinach, added back at Step 5. My wife & I are vegan, so I used my own recipe for non-dairy ricotta. Spot on texture and flavor. Red pepper flakes added as a topper when plated; I prefer chili crisp in the mix (Step 2). Used rice noodle linguine, 16 oz, and rescaled all proportions. Texture was more crumbly than creamy, which I prefer. Salt flake topper makes the flavors pop. Can't wait to taste the leftovers!\n\nI don't consume dairy, so ricotta and butter were out. I roasted the chickpeas at 400 for about twenty minutes, and the broccoli on another sheet pan with the garlic, red pepper flakes (and added a few oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes) for about 15 minutes. I didn't have kale. I added a bit of plant \"butter\" and nutritional yeast for some \"cheesiness\". All in all, very satisfying.\n\nHi @Linda! We don’t do dairy either. I often make my own ricotta as well as other vegan cheeses. My 1st Gen Italian mother made her own ricotta and pastas, so I grew up on those flavors. Here’s my easy recipe for a nut-free vegan ricotta w/vegan cream cheese. This imitation ricotta would make Mamma proud! 1 block (14-15 oz) x/firm tofu, drained & gently pressed. 6 oz vegan unsweetened cream cheese. 2 tbsp lemon juice. 1 tsp ea, salt, garlic powder, Italian seasonings, plus more to taste. ¾ tsp Nooch, plus more to taste. Combine ingredients in a large mixing bowl. Mix & mash with a fork to desired consistency. For creamier ricotta add a tbsp room temp water, up to 3 tbsp. Adjust lemon juice & seasonings to taste. Use immediately, or store in fridge up to 5 days. I use this ricotta in many things: manicotti, lasagna, etc. Makes a great topper on salads, too.\n\nPrivate comments are only visible to you.",
  "https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/honey-roasted-root-vegetable-salad": "\n\n> **Scraped from [Food & Wine](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/honey-roasted-root-vegetable-salad)**\n\n### Make the salad\n\n1.  Preheat the oven to 400°F. Tightly wrap the beets in a double layer of aluminum foil and roast them on the bottom shelf of the oven for 1 1/2 hours, or until they are tender when pierced with the tip of a knife. When the beets are cool enough to handle, peel and cut them into 1-inch pieces.\n    \n2.  Meanwhile, divide the carrots, parsnips and turnips between 2 large rimmed baking sheets. Toss the vegetables in each pan with 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil. Arrange the onion wedges on the baking sheets, keeping them intact. Brush the onion wedges all over with the remaining 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. Generously season the vegetables with salt and pepper. Roast the vegetables for 40 minutes. Brush the vegetables with the warm honey and sprinkle with the sage. Continue to roast the vegetables for 25 minutes longer, or until they are tender and glazed. Loosen the vegetables with a spatula and let them cool to room temperature in the pans.\n    \n3.  In a small bowl, mix the goat cheese with the herbs and olive oil and season with salt and pepper.\n    \n4.  In a small bowl, combine the olive oil with the vinegar, garlic and herbs; season with salt and pepper. In a large bowl, toss the arugula with 1 tablespoon of the vinaigrette and arrange on plates. Add the roasted vegetables (including beets) to the bowl and toss with the remaining vinaigrette. Top the arugula with the vegetables, dot each plate with small spoonfuls of the herbed goat cheese and serve.\n    \n\nAbout this recipe\n-----------------\n\nThis fall harvest salad makes the most of seasonal root vegetables. Beets, carrots, parsnips, turnips, and onions mingle together to create the dish. They’re roasted until tender, brushed with honey and fresh sage, and then roasted some more until the glaze becomes sticky-sweet. Arranged on a bed of lightly dressed arugula and topped with herbed goat cheese, roasted root vegetable salad makes an elegant main course or side.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n--------------------------\n\n### Should I boil root vegetables before roasting?\n\nWhile some chefs call for par-boiling root vegetables before roasting them, this step isn’t necessary. If you set the oven to the optimal temperature (we think 400℉ to 425℉ is best for roasted vegetables) and use a generous amount of olive oil, the vegetables will brown on the outside as they cook through.\n\n### What is the best way to eat root vegetables?\n\nAlthough most root vegetables can be eaten raw, we think they taste even better when cooked. Roasted root vegetables glazed with maple syrup or honey is delicious during the fall season, and a classic mash is also comforting. You can also dice them into small pieces and stir into a soup or stew. If you really want to enjoy root vegetables such as carrots, parsnips, and turnips raw, slice them thin on a mandoline and scatter them over a crunchy salad.  \n\nNotes from the Food & Wine Test Kitchen\n---------------------------------------\n\nHere’s how we peel beets easily in the test kitchen: Roast the beets, then let them rest for about 10 minutes before handling; you want them to be warm so they are easier to peel, but cool enough to handle comfortably. To peel, cup one beet in an old (but clean!) dish towel and rub the towel against the beet to remove the skin. Repeat with the remaining beets, then slice, dice, and serve.\n\nMake ahead\n----------\n\nThe herbed goat cheese and the vinaigrette can be refrigerated overnight. Bring the goat cheese to room temperature before serving the salad. The vegetables can be roasted earlier in the day and kept at room temperature.",

It's an easy and delicious weeknight meal.\n\nThis post may contain affiliate links.

In this case, shrimp, cabbage, thin slices of onion, mushrooms, and carrots are tangled up with the nooodles.\n\nA sweet-savory sauce made of oyster sauce, [hoisin sauce](https://amzn.to/3rNA4v4), and other ingredients finishes off the Shrimp Yakisoba recipe.\n\nIf you love [Beef Yakisoba](https://allwaysdelicious.com/yakisoba/), this Shrimp Yakisoba is a nice change of pace. It has all the same great flavors, but is a bit lighter and lets the veggies really shine. For another seafood-plus-noodles dish that makes a quick, easy and delicious weeknight dinner, try this [Tuna Pesto Pasta](https://twocloveskitchen.com/tuna-pesto-pasta/).\n\n![A bowl of shrimp yakisoba ingredients for asian fried rice.](https://allwaysdelicious.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Shrimp-Yakisoba-ingredients.jpg)\n\n**WHAT INGREDIENTS DO YOU NEED?**\n---------------------------------\n\nShrimp Yakisoba is a great weeknight dish because it requires just a few basic ingredients. If you don’t have the exact ingredients listed, you can substitute what you do have. This stir fried noodles recipe is super flexible.\n\n*   **Cooking oil**—You can use any high smoke point, neutral flavored oil. I like peanut oil, avocado oil, grapeseed oil, safflower oil, canola oil, etc.\n*   **Shrimp**—Save yourself time and effort and buy shrimp that is already peeled and deveined.\n*   **Noodles**—[Yakisoba noodles](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=yakisoba%20noodles&i=grocery&crid=SBRBTCSV74Z1&sprefix=yakisoba%20noodles%2Cgrocery%2C128&linkCode=sl2&tag=twola-20&linkId=6a9bf1ec3429a8974acb33311998c202&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) are different from soba noodles (the ones made from buckwheat and usually served cold). They are more similar to [ramen](https://allwaysdelicious.com/ramen-for-beginners-2/) noodles. [Yakisoba noodles](https://amzn.to/3rP9UIw) are made from wheat flour with _kansui_ (an alkalinizing agent), which gives them a springy texture and yellowish tint. Use dry yakisoba noodles or [chuka soba](https://amzn.to/3MuVBki) noodles or fresh or frozen yakisoba noodles. You can substitute udon noodles or even spaghetti noodles, but the texture will of course be different.\n*   **Vegetables**—Use a mixture of cabbage, carrots, mushrooms, and onions—or substitute what you have on hand. For instance, try adding sliced bell pepper, bean sprouts, or broccoli, if you have them.\n*   **Homemade yakisoba sauce**—The Shrimp Yakisoba Sauce easy to whip up using soy sauce, [Worcestershire sauce](https://www.amazon.com/Bull-Dog-Worcestershire-Sauce-10-1-Fl/dp/B0002IZD0W?crid=3TGZ5GMKQKN31&keywords=Worcestershire+sauce+japanese&qid=1659562836&sprefix=worcestershire+sauce+japanese%2Caps%2C146&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=twola-20&linkId=32c18dddef1c970403c338557e2ebcb5&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, [chile paste](https://amzn.to/3LfWFbt), and sugar.

They were seriously discounted on Amazon just in time for the holidays. Since I don't want my family to starve I thought I would start writing up recipes for them and put them on here as well. There is already a killer chicken taco recipe on my site, but up next is turkey and sweet potato chili. \n\nIf you are unfamiliar with the Instant Pot it is a counter top pressure cooker with a cult like following. My sister introduced me to it and I have totally started drinking the Instant Pot kool-aid. Since it is a pressure cooker, it cooks so many dishes in significantly less time compared to the stovetop or the oven. Plus the insert is dish washer safe so you can just through it in the dishwasher after you have eaten. I love it for stews and chilis but it also makes everything from hummus to yogurt to vegetables. \n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57b1e02337c581699cc7c4f0/1484516265333-FISWVEA90YDWQ2UELF4G/image-asset.jpeg)\n\nI have been making this recipe non-stop these past couple weeks. Feel free to substitute ground turkey for ground beef or pork. I love this recipe because it is healthy, full of flavor and most of all easy. Enjoy! \n\nInstant Pot Turkey and Sweet Potato Chili \n------------------------------------------\n\n*   1 Tbs. olive oil\n*   1/2 onion, diced\n*   2 cloves garlic, minced\n*   1 lb. ground turkey \n*   1 Tbs. chili powder\n*   1/2 tsp. paprika \n*   1/2 tsp. ground cumin\n*   1 tsp. salt, plus more to taste\n*   1 1/2 lbs. sweet potato, diced into 1/2\" dice\n*   28 oz. can crushed tomatoes \n*   1 tsp. tomato paste\n*   1/2 cup chicken broth\n*   1 15. oz can black beans, drained and rinsed\n\nGarnishes such as avocado, sour cream, cotija cheese, cilantro, green onions and jalapeños. \n\nUsing the sauté function, add the olive oil and onion. Cook for about 1 to 2 minutes or until the onion begins to soften. Add the garlic and ground turkey. Brown the ground turkey for about 2 to 3 minutes, breaking up large chunks. Add the chili powder, paprika, cumin, salt, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, tomato paste and chicken broth. Stir well to combine. \n\nAdd the lid to the Instant Pot and using the manual function set the timer to 12 minutes. \n\nLet the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then manually release the pressure. Fold in the black beans, taste for salt and serve warm with assorted garnishes. \n\nServes 4 to 6",

Speaking of, it’s 10 am and I’m writing with a happy belly.\n\nThis Thai red curry made a fantastic meal last night and perhaps an even better breakfast this morning.

You should be able to find everything you need for this simple curry at a well-stocked grocery store.\n\n### Watch How to Make Thai Red Curry\n\n*   The secret to making amazing Thai curries is to use plenty of aromatics, like onion, ginger and garlic.\n*   Choose full-fat coconut milk for its richness (you won’t regret it!).\n*   Stirring in just a little bit of rice vinegar and sugar adds _tons_ of complexity.\n*   Readily available store-bought Thai red curry paste adds characteristic Thai flavor and, bonus, the Thai Kitchen brand is vegetarian.

You could try broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, diced butternut or sweet potato (which will probably require a longer cooking time), sliced zucchini and/or yellow squash.\n\n![how to make Thai red curry with vegetables](https://cookieandkate.com/images/2015/10/how-to-make-thai-red-curry-1.jpg)\n\n![Thai red curry with coconut milk and vegetables!

It’s much tastier than takeout and healthier, too. Feel free to change up the vegetables (you’ll need about 3 cups total) and skip the kale if you want a more traditional Thai curry. This recipe is vegetarian, vegan and gluten free for all to enjoy. Recipe yields 4 servings.\n\n*   1 ¼ cups brown jasmine rice or long-grain brown rice, rinsed\n*   1 tablespoon coconut oil or olive oil\n*   1 small white onion, chopped (about 1 cup)\n*   Pinch of salt, more to taste\n*   1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger (about a 1-inch nub of ginger)\n*   2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced\n*   1 red bell pepper, sliced into thin 2-inch long strips\n*   1 yellow, orange or green bell pepper, sliced into thin 2-inch long strips\n*   3 carrots, peeled and sliced on the diagonal into ¼-inch thick rounds (about 1 cup)\n*   2 tablespoons [Thai red curry paste](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007QR5EPQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B007QR5EPQ&linkCode=as2&tag=cooandkatingr-20&linkId=D4TIRRJCV6NG2FAQ)\\*\n*   1 can (14 ounces) regular coconut milk\\*\\*\n*   ½ cup water\n*   1 ½ cups packed thinly sliced kale (tough ribs removed first), preferably the Tuscan/lacinato/dinosaur variety\n*   1 ½ teaspoons coconut sugar or turbinado (raw) sugar or brown sugar\n*   1 tablespoon tamari or soy sauce\\*\\*\\*\n*   2 teaspoons rice vinegar or fresh lime juice\n*   Garnishes/sides: handful of chopped fresh basil or cilantro, optional red pepper flakes, optional sriracha or chili garlic sauce\n\n1.  To cook the rice, bring a large pot of water to boil. Add the rinsed rice and continue boiling for 30 minutes, reducing heat as necessary to prevent overflow. Remove from heat, drain the rice and return the rice to pot. Cover and let the rice rest for 10 minutes or longer, until you’re ready to serve. Just before serving, season the rice to taste with salt and fluff it with a fork.\n2.  To make the curry, warm a large skillet with deep sides over medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the oil. Add the onion and a sprinkle of salt and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds, while stirring continuously.\n3.  Add the bell peppers and carrots. Cook until the bell peppers are fork-tender, 3 to 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add the curry paste and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes.\n4.  Add the coconut milk, water, kale and sugar, and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat. Reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the peppers, carrots and kale have softened to your liking, about 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n5.  Remove the pot from the heat and season with tamari and rice vinegar. Add salt (I added ¼ teaspoon for optimal flavor), to taste. If the curry needs a little more punch, add ½ teaspoon more tamari, or for more acidity, add ½ teaspoon more rice vinegar. Divide rice and curry into bowls and garnish with chopped cilantro and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, if you’d like. If you love spicy curries, serve with sriracha or chili garlic sauce on the side.\n\n### Notes\n\n_Recipe adapted from my [Thai green curry recipe](https://cookieandkate.com/thai-green-curry-with-spring-vegetables/)._  \n**\\*Red Thai curry paste:** Look for it in the Asian section of the grocery store. I like Thai Kitchen brand, which is vegetarian. Not all brands are (they can contain fish sauce and/or shrimp paste).  \n**\\*\\*Coconut milk:** For rich and creamy curry, you need to use regular (not light/reduced fat) coconut milk that contains guar gum. My favorite is Native Forest Classic. The varieties without guar gum (which are becoming more widely available) aren’t nearly as creamy, even though their fat content is the same.  \n**\\*\\*\\*Make it gluten free:** Be sure to use gluten-free tamari instead of regular soy sauce.  \n**If you want to add tofu:** I’d suggest [baking it first](https://cookieandkate.com/how-to-make-crispy-baked-tofu/) and adding it with the coconut milk in step 4. If you add raw tofu, it will soak up too much of the liquid, and baking it greatly improves the texture, anyway.  \n**Update 8/10/2016:** I tweaked this recipe a tiny bit to make it richer and more flavorful (decreased water from ¾ cup to ½ cup, and increased tamari to 1 tablespoon and vinegar to 2 teaspoons). I also updated the post with better photos!  \n**If you love this recipe:** Be sure to check out my other [Thai-inspired recipes here](https://cookieandkate.com/category/vegetarian-thai-recipes/)!

This classic recipe uses two meats and three cheeses for amazing flavor. Your favorite store-bought spaghetti sauce keeps it simple_.\n\nAbout two years ago we shared our family’s best lasagna recipe. It is 100% homemade (ok not the pasta, but the rest is homemade). It takes a little work, but it is so good and so worth it.\n\n![a spatula pulling out a piece of lasagna](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/easy-lasagna-recipe_-15.jpg)\n\nWhat readers are saying about this easy lasagna recipe:\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n**_Jeff says_**, “I’m a guy that just does not like to cook! I love to eat but just don’t have an enough of an imagination to make something good. But after making this simple lasagna recipe, everybody loved it. The taste was awesome but also just to look at it after it was done in the oven looked amazing! Believe me I never talk about something I’ve made like this but it truly was perfect.” ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ \n\n**_Pat says_**, “I made this homemade lasagna recipe today and it was a terrific hit! My mother-in-law said it was the best lasagna she has ever tasted! Thank you so much for this delicious recipe.” ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ \n\nLasagna with Ricotta or Cottage Cheese?\n---------------------------------------\n\nWhen I was growing up, I always had lasagna with cottage cheese. I didn’t love the texture of ricotta so my mom always put cottage cheese in lasagna instead.\n\nThese days I’m more tolerant of ricotta in lasagna. You can **_use either cottage cheese OR ricotta_** in this recipe. Use the same amount for either cheese you choose to use in this no boil pasta lasagna. You can even mix cottage cheese and ricotta cheese together. Both are delicious, but ricotta is more authentic.\n\nThis same thing applies to our [baked rigatoni with sausage and mozzarella](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/baked-rigatoni-and-sausage/)!\n\nIngredients for Lasagna\n-----------------------\n\nThis no boil pasta lasagna has simple ingredients, most of which are pantry staples. \n\n![ingredients for easy lasagna on a table](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ingredients-for-easy-lasagna-recipe.jpg)\n\n**A few notes:**\n\n*   **Ground beef and Italian sausage**. A combination of these two meats give the best flavor. You can season ground pork with our [homemade Italian sausage seasoning](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/homemade-italian-sausage-seasoning/) if you prefer. \n*   **Spaghetti sauce**. This is excellent with a store-bought sauce such as Rao’s marinara or try our [homemade spaghetti sauce](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/healthy-homemade-spaghetti-sauce/). I also use Rao’s in my [pizza pasta casserole](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/pizza-pasta-bake/).\n*   **Lasagna noodles**. Can you use the dry lasagna noodles without boiling? Yes! We don’t even specifically use oven-ready noodles. Just use [regular lasagna noodles](https://amzn.to/3HV6njm) and they should cook just fine if you follow our instructions.\n\n**✨ _See the_** [**_recipe card_**](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/easy-lasagna-recipe/#wprm-recipe-container-31329) **_for the full ingredient list._ ✨**\n\n**How to Make this Easy Lasagna** Recipe\n----------------------------------------\n\n*   In a large skillet over medium heat **brown the ground beef and sausage together**. Drain off and discard any fat. **Add the minced garlic and spaghetti sauce**. Simmer for 5 minutes.\n\n![browned meat with garlic and spaghetti sauce over the top](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/easy-lasagna-recipe_-3.jpg)\n\n2.  In a large bowl, **mix together the cheese mixture**: ricotta cheese, 2 cups of the mozzarella cheese, eggs, ½ cup of grated Parmesan cheese, dried parsley, salt and ground black pepper. Mix well.\n\n![cheese mixture for lasagna in a bowl](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/easy-lasagna-recipe_-4.jpg)\n\n3.  **To assemble**, spread ¾ cup of sauce on the bottom of the baking pan. Cover the bottom with 3 uncooked lasagna noodles. Top with ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture and ¼ of the sauce. **Repeat layers** (noodles, cheese, sauce, noodles, cheese, sauce).\n4.  **For the top layer**, add 3 noodles, remaining sauce, remaining 1 cup mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.\n\n![collage of how to layer lasagna](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lasagna-collage-1200x1200.jpg)\n\n5.  Spray a sheet of aluminum foil with cooking spray. **Cover with the pan** with aluminum foil (sprayed side down). This prevents the cheese from sticking. **Bake in the preheated oven for 50 minutes. Uncover and bake an additional 10 minutes.** \n6.  **Let the lasagna stand for 10 minutes** before cutting and serving.\n\n### Pro tip\n\nIf your pasta sauce is a thick, hearty sauce, add ½ cup water to the edges of the pan. If your sauce is runnier like Old World Style Ragu or even Rao’s marinara sauce, you won’t need as much water.\n\n![overhead view of a spatula pulling out a piece of lasagna](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/easy-lasagna-recipe_-13.jpg)\n\n![julie clark in a kitchen](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/headshot-julie-2-268x268.jpg)\n\n**How to Reheat Lasagna**\n-------------------------\n\nIf you are wanting to heat leftover lasagna that is in a pan, cover it with foil and bake it in an oven that you’ve preheated to 350º Fahrenheit. Bake it until the internal temperature reaches 165º F. This will take at least 30 minutes, but depending on how much is left, could take up to 50 minutes.\n\nYou can also reheat individual slices on a plate in the microwave.\n\n![a piece of lasagna on a plate with a fork](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/easy-lasagna-recipe_-22.jpg)\n\n**Can you freeze lasagna?**\n---------------------------\n\nYes! You can freeze this easy lasagna recipe both before and/or after you cook it. Here are a few tips:\n\n*   **Use a disposable aluminum pan** to make your lasagna in. Then you can easily wrap the unbaked lasagna and freeze it.\n*   If you are baking the lasagna before freezing it, **allow the lasagna to cool completely before wrapping it**.\n*   **Wrap the lasagna twice in plastic wrap and once in foil**.\n*   **Remove the frozen lasagna from the freezer the day before you want to bake it**. This will help it bake more quickly in the oven.\n*   **Freeze for 2-3 months.**\n\n**How to Cook Frozen Lasagna**\n------------------------------\n\nThis easy lasagna recipe will cook the most evenly and have the best results if you remove the lasagna from the freezer the day before you want to cook it. This will help it to mostly defrost and bake more easily.\n\n*   Remove the wrappings, then cover with just one layer of foil.\n*   Bake in a 350º F oven covered for about 50 minutes, then uncover and bake an additional 10 minutes.\n*   \\*\\*If the lasagna was previously baked, you won’t need to bake it as long. Start at 30 minutes covered, then uncover and bake until heated through and bubbly on the edges.\n\n![easy lasagna recipe with one piece on a spatula](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/easy-lasagna-recipe-recipecard-268x268.jpg)\n\nServings 15\n\nPrep Time 20 minutes\n\nCook Time 1 hour\n\nResting Time 10 minutes\n\n* * *\n\n*   1 pound ground beef\n*   ½ pound sweet Italian sausage\n*   1 teaspoon minced garlic\n*   48 ounces [spaghetti sauce](https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/healthy-homemade-spaghetti-sauce/) (your favorite sauce)\n*   15 ounces ricotta cheese (or cottage cheese)\n*   3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese\n*   2 large eggs\n*   3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n*   2 teaspoons dried parsley or 4 tablespoons freshly snipped\n*   ¼ teaspoon [salt](https://amzn.to/48A9tFt)\n*   ¼ teaspoon ground pepper\n*   12 lasagna noodles\n*   ¼ cup water\\*\\*\n\n*   To prepare, preheat the oven to 350ºF and spray a 9×13 casserole dish with cooking spray.\n    \n*   In a large skillet over medium heat brown the ground beef and sausage together.

  "https://smittenkitchen.com/2023/09/simple-eggplant-parmesan/": "\n\n> **Scraped from [smitten kitchen](https://smittenkitchen.com/2023/09/simple-eggplant-parmesan/)**\n\n[Last year](https://smittenkitchen.com/2022/09/eggplant-involtini/) I told you that despite it being the opposite of eggplant season, I crave eggplant parmesan incessantly each winter. I mean, who doesn’t want an aromatic, cheese-stretchy, cozy casserole of ziti-like flavors, but without the heaviness of the pasta sometimes, right? What this post omitted was my recipe, which was kind of rude. The truth is that I wasn’t completely comfortable sharing the recipe because it’s not a True eggplant parmesan, or so I believed. It’s not breaded, it’s not fried, and there’s definitely no ricotta. Even the title of the recipe as it was saved on my computer was self-conscious: _(Not Really) Eggplant Parmesan_.\n\n  \n![](https://i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/simple-eggplant-parmesan-collage1.jpg?resize=640%2C429&ssl=1)  \n![](https://i0.wp.com/smittenkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/simple-eggplant-parmesan-collage2.jpg?resize=640%2C429&ssl=1)\n\nSo what changed? [Going to Italy this summer!](https://smittenkitchen.com/travel/two-weeks-in-italy/) We ordered eggplant parmesan (parmigiana di melanzane) almost every time we saw it on the menu and do you know what would come out? A dish that looked like this — no breading, no crumbs, no ricotta. It made more sense when I read about the [history of the dish from Emiko Davies](https://food52.com/blog/13926-what-does-classic-eggplant-parmigiana-really-mean) which I’ll simply link to rather than poorly summarize (it’s fascinating!) but it also gave me the nudge to finally spring the recipe from my kitchen to yours.\n\n![simple eggplant parmesan-13](https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/53169305880_42da199dd1_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&ssl=1)\n\nI think it’s heavenly: Thick slices of fresh eggplant are salted, dabbed dry, and roasted in a generous application of olive oil at high heat until deeply brown on both sides — i.e. almost like fried but without the oil splatters and spread of paper towels to drain the grease. While they roast, you make a simple tomato sauce on the stove with onion, garlic, and pepper flakes softened in olive oil. You fan the slices of eggplant in a dish with sauce under and over them, cover it with a heap of mozzarella and parmesan, and bake it until blistered, cozy, and absolutely spoonable, with stretches of cheese trying to drag each spoonful back to the pan. Spoiler: It will fail; you will win.\n\n![simple eggplant parmesan-14](https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/53168281392_44c0637789_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&ssl=1)\n\n##### Video\n\n##### Previously\n\n**6 months ago:** [Easy Freezer Waffles](https://smittenkitchen.com/2023/03/easy-freezer-waffles/)  \n**1 year ago:** [Eggplant Involtini](https://smittenkitchen.com/2022/09/eggplant-involtini/)  \n**2 years ago:** [Baked Farro with Summer Vegetables](https://smittenkitchen.com/2021/08/baked-farro-with-summer-vegetables/)  \n**3 years ago:** [Shaved Fennel and Crushed Olive Salad](https://smittenkitchen.com/2020/08/shaved-fennel-and-crushed-olive-salad/) and [Corn Coconut Soup](https://smittenkitchen.com/2020/08/corn-coconut-soup/)  \n**4 years ago:** [Salted Caramel Pretzel Blondies](https://smittenkitchen.com/2019/08/salted-caramel-pretzel-blondies/)  \n**5 years ago:** [Foolproof Cacio e Pepe](https://smittenkitchen.com/2018/09/foolproof-cacio-e-pepe/)  \n**6 years ago:** [Cheesecake Bars with All The Berries](https://smittenkitchen.com/2017/08/cheesecake-bars-with-all-the-berries/) and [Corn Chowder with Chile, Lime, and Cotija](https://smittenkitchen.com/2017/08/corn-chowder-with-chile-lime-and-cotija/)  \n**7 years ago:** [Eggplant Parmesan Melts](https://smittenkitchen.com/2016/08/eggplant-parmesan-melts/) and [Even More Perfect Blueberry Muffins](https://smittenkitchen.com/2016/08/even-more-perfect-blueberry-muffins/)  \n**8 years ago:** [Angel Hair Pasta with Raw Tomato Sauce](https://smittenkitchen.com/2015/08/angel-hair-pasta-with-raw-tomato-sauce/), [Crispy Peach Cobbler](https://smittenkitchen.com/2015/08/crispy-peach-cobbler/), and [Corn Chowder Salad](https://smittenkitchen.com/2015/08/corn-chowder-salad/)  \n**9 years ago:** [Strawberries and Cream with Graham Crumbles](https://smittenkitchen.com/2014/08/strawberries-and-cream-with-graham-crumbles/) and [Corn Cheddar and Scallion Strata](https://smittenkitchen.com/2014/09/corn-cheddar-and-scallion-strata/)  \n**10 years ago:** [Almond-Crisped Peaches](https://smittenkitchen.com/2013/08/almond-crisped-peaches-uk-book-tour/), [Key Lime Popsicles](https://smittenkitchen.com/2013/08/key-lime-pie-popsicles/) and [Zucchini Parmesan Crisps](https://smittenkitchen.com/2013/09/zucchini-parmesan-crisps/)  \n**11 years ago:** [Mediterranean Baked Feta with Tomatoes](https://smittenkitchen.com/2012/08/mediterranean-baked-feta-with-tomatoes/), [Leek, Chard, and Corn Flatbread](https://smittenkitchen.com/2012/08/leek-chard-and-corn-flatbread/) and [Vanilla Custards with Roasted Blueberries](https://smittenkitchen.com/2012/08/vanilla-custards-with-roasted-blueberries/)  \n**12 years ago:** [Hazelnut Plum-Crumb Tart](https://smittenkitchen.com/2011/08/hazelnut-plum-crumb-tart/), [Zucchini Fritters](https://smittenkitchen.com/2011/08/zucchini-fritters/), and [Naked Tomato Sauce](https://smittenkitchen.com/2011/08/naked-tomato-sauce/)  \n**13 years ago:** [Eggplant Salad Toasts](https://smittenkitchen.com/2010/08/eggplant-salad-toasts/) and [Peach Shortbread](https://smittenkitchen.com/2010/09/peach-shortbread/)  \n**14 years ago:** [Griled Eggplant and Olive Pizza](https://smittenkitchen.com/2009/08/grilled-eggplant-and-olive-pizza/) and [Peach Cupcakes with Brown Sugar Frosting](https://smittenkitchen.com/2009/08/peach-cupcakes-with-brown-sugar-frosting/)  \n**15 years ago:** [Slow-Roasted Tomatoes](https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/08/slow-roasted-tomatoes/), [Kefta and Zucchini Kebabs](https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/08/kefta-and-zucchini-kebabs/) and [Dimply Plum Cake](https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/08/dimply-plum-cake/)  \n**16 years ago:** [Double Chocolate Torte](https://smittenkitchen.com/2007/08/never-too-much/) and [Spicy Soba Noodles with Shiitakes](https://smittenkitchen.com/2007/08/so-good-soba/)  \n**17 years ago:** [Moules Frites](https://smittenkitchen.com/2006/08/moules-frites/) and [44-Clove Garlic Soup](https://smittenkitchen.com/2006/08/a-44-clove-ticket-to-a-happier-place/)\n\n### Simple Eggplant Parmesan\n\n*   2 pounds eggplant, cut into generous 1/2-inch slices\n*   Kosher salt\n*   Olive oil\n*   Freshly ground black pepper\n*   1 small onion, finely chopped\n*   3 garlic cloves, minced\n*   1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes\n*   1 28-ounce can of whole tomatoes\n*   1 teaspoon dried oregano\n*   Handful fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped\n*   1/2 cup finely grated parmesan or pecorino cheese\n*   8 ounces grated or thinly-sliced mozzarella\n\n**Prepare the eggplant:** Arrange eggplant slices on a large (half-sheet) baking pan in one layer. Sprinkle with about 2 teaspoons kosher salt and set aside for 30 minutes.\n\n**Heat oven:** To 425°F (220°C) degrees.\n\n**Roast eggplant:** Transfer eggplant slices to paper towels and blot them of as much excess water as possible. Dry the baking sheet, too, and coat it with 3 tablespoons of olive oil and sprinkle the oil with several grinds of black pepper. Arrange eggplant slices in one layer. Drizzle with 2 more tablespoons of oil and more grinds of black pepper. Roast until nicely browned underneath, 20 to 25 minutes. Use a thin spatula to turn eggplant slices over and roast until browned underneath on the second side, another 10 minutes. It’s okay if they’re not cooked through yet. Reduce oven temperature to 375°F (175°C).\n\n**Meanwhile, make sauce:** While eggplant roasts, open your can of tomatoes and use kitchen shears or very well-washed scissors to chop the tomatoes into small bits. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium/large saucepan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add onion and cook until it softens, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and pepper flakes and cook another minute. Add tomatoes (beware the splatter!), oregano, and season with 1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste. Let mixture simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. If you’d like the sauce smoother than it is now, you can mash the tomatoes further with a potato masher as it cooks, or use an immersion blender for a completely smooth sauce. Stir in basil then taste the sauce; adjust salt and pepper to taste.\n\n**Assemble:** In a 1.5- to 2-quart baking dish (holding 6 to 8 cups; I’m using [this](https://amzn.to/46kTCsX)), spoon about 1/2 cup of the sauce. Arrange about half of the eggplant slices, slightly overlapped, in one layer. Spoon another 1/2 cup sauce over and spread it evenly. Arrange remaining eggplant slices, then ladle more sauce over it so it’s as saucy as you like. \\[Keep unused sauce in fridge for another day; it will keep for 4 to 5 days.\\] Sprinkle top with mozzarella and parmesan.\n\n**Bake:** For 30 minutes, until cheese has melted and sauce is bubbling all over. For more color on top, you can run it briefly under your oven’s broiler.\n\n**To serve:** Once baked, let the eggplant parmesan rest at room temperature, if you can bear it, for 15 minutes before digging in — this helps the ingredients settle and come together more. It’s not mandatory, but this is excellent with a side of [garlic bread](https://smittenkitchen.com/2016/04/perfect-garlic-bread/).\n\n**Do ahead:** Eggplant parmesan keeps fantastically in the fridge for up to 5 days. Rewarm in a 350-degree oven, covered for the first half of the time, for about 25 to 30 minutes. You can also freeze it, well wrapped, for a few months.\n\nPost navigation\n---------------",

Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper; dredge in the parmesan mixture; shake off excess and set aside.\n\n**2.** In a large non-stick skillet melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat. Cook chicken cutlets until golden on each side and cooked through – about 3-4 minutes for each side, depending on the thickness of your chicken cutlets. Transfer to a plate.\n\n**The Parmesan Cauliflower Rice**\n\n**1.** In the same pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Fry the garlic and onion for 1 minute until fragrant — be careful not to burn.\n\n**2.** Add the **riced cauliflower** to the skillet and stir to mix everything together well and coat in melted butter. Cook, stirring regularly for 1 minute.\n\n**3.** Stir in the 2 tablespoons vegetable stock, about half the parsley, and lemon zest (if using). Cook the cauliflower rice for one minute to reduce juices then add the lemon juice and a few sprinkles of leftover parmesan cheese, if you like.\n\n**4.** Adjust seasoning as needed. Stir in the remaining parsley. Return chicken breasts over **cauliflower rice** and reheat quickly. Serve your parmesan chicken with fresh cracked black pepper, red chili pepper flakes, and more parmesan. Enjoy!\n\n**Note:** Make sure to use a non-stick pan, otherwise the parmesan might stick.\n\n![Garlic Butter Chicken with Parmesan Cauliflower Rice - #eatwell101 #recipe Crispy, soft and SO delish!

  "https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/simple-carbonara": "\n\n> **Scraped from [Bon Appétit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/simple-carbonara)**\n\nWith crispy pork, a velvety sauce, and a punch of black pepper, spaghetti carbonara delivers soothing comfort and big flavor in under 30 minutes. It’s a signature Roman dish (in the same family as [cacio e pepe](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/cacio-e-pepe)) that shines by staying simple. Egg yolks provide the sauce’s luscious texture and golden hue; they’re cooked gently as you toss them with the hot pasta, so timing and following the order of operations as indicated is key.\n\nUse quality ingredients—preferably guanciale, good cheese (such as Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano Reggiano), and [bronze-cut spaghetti](https://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/how-to-choose-and-buy-the-best-pasta-article) for a cozy dinner with flair. At dinner, this dish is nice served with a [salad of mixed greens](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/everyday-greens-salad), but when you’re in the throes of an after-hours hang, just grab a fork.\n\nTips and FAQs for the best spaghetti carbonara\n----------------------------------------------\n\n*   **What is guanciale? Are there any substitutes?**  \n    Guanciale (cured pork jowl) is traditional in spaghetti carbonara, but pancetta or even thick-cut [American bacon](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-bacon) will be fine if you can’t find it. Don’t eat pork? Look for turkey prosciutto, beef bacon, or similar products. The key is fatty, flavorful meat.\n*   **Can I add cream, garlic, or onions?**  \n    Classic spaghetti carbonara doesn’t require any of these ingredients. Keep it simple with eggs, cheese, pork, pasta, and pepper for traditional texture and flavor.\n*   **How do I avoid scrambled eggs?**  \n    Remove the pan from the heat before adding the egg and cheese mixture. Gently toss the hot pasta with tongs or a pasta fork _while_ pouring in the mixture, plus a splash of reserved pasta water, until you achieve a smooth, creamy, emulsified sauce.\n*   **Can I mix cheeses?**  \n    Absolutely. Pecorino Romano is sharper and saltier; Parmesan adds nuttiness. Using a combination brings the best of both to the party. Other options include Grana Padano, Piave, and Asiago cheese, but note that these will alter the dish’s intended flavor.\n*   **How much pasta water should I use?**  \n    You’ll need to reserve at least ¾ cup of the salty, starchy [pasta cooking liquid](https://www.bonappetit.com/story/save-your-pasta-water). About ¼ cup of it is mixed into the egg mixture before tossing it with the pasta. With the remaining ½ cup, add just enough so the spaghetti is coated in a silky sauce. Add a splash at a time (think 1–2 Tbsp.), then toss until the consistency is glossy but not watery.",
  "https://whatgreatgrandmaate.com/mayak-eggs/": "\n\n> **Scraped from [What Great Grandma Ate](https://whatgreatgrandmaate.com/mayak-eggs/)**\n\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Please see our [disclosure policy](https://whatgreatgrandmaate.com/privacy-disclosure-policy/).\n\nThese **mayak eggs** are my go-to when I want something simple, satisfying, and packed with flavor. Traditionally made with soy sauce, these Korean marinated eggs (mayak gyeran) are savory, spicy, slightly sweet, and deeply umami — and in this version, they’re made soy-free and gluten-free with coconut aminos. They’re every bit as flavorful and addicting, and just as perfect over a bowl of warm rice or tucked into a lunch box.\n\n**Jeans Notes:** Mayak eggs are soft-boiled Korean eggs marinated in soy sauce (or a soy-free substitute), garlic, chili, and sesame oil. They’re easy to make at home and typically served over rice, noodles, or as a lunchbox side.\n\n![A sliced Mayak egg served over rice in a bowl](https://whatgreatgrandmaate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/mayak-eggs-korean-marinated-eggs-6.jpg)\n\nWhy You’ll Love This Recipe\n---------------------------\n\nThis is one of those recipes that feels like a little secret weapon in the fridge. Soft-boiled eggs soak up a bold marinade overnight, turning into a deeply flavorful side or snack. While the traditional recipe uses soy sauce and mirin, I’ve adapted it with coconut aminos to make it friendly for those avoiding soy or gluten — and honestly, you might not even notice the swap.\n\nThe eggs come out tender with jammy yolks and a marinade that’s rich with garlic, green onions, sesame, and a touch of heat from chili peppers. It’s great for meal prep, and even better as a gateway into Korean cooking if you’re new to it, especially paired with these [Korean Dumplings (Mandu)](https://whatgreatgrandmaate.com/korean-dumplings-mandu/) for a complete banchan-style lunch. \n\nEach egg is packed with protein and flavor, and the whole dish is gluten-free and dairy-free. For another great fridge-friendly Korean dish, try this [Korean Cucumber Salad (Oi Muchim)](https://whatgreatgrandmaate.com/korean-cucumber-salad-oi-muchim/).\n\nIngredients You’ll Need\n-----------------------\n\n![mayak eggs ingredients on a counter including honey, sesame seeds, coconut aminos, greens onions, chili peppers, salt, garlic, vinegar, and eggs. ](https://whatgreatgrandmaate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mayak-eggs-ingredients.jpg)\n\n*   **Eggs:** Use large eggs and soft-boil them just until the yolks are jammy. You can also hard-boil if you prefer a firmer texture.\n*   **Vinegar & Salt:** Add these to your boiling water for easy-peel shells. A small detail that makes a big difference.\n*   **Coconut Aminos:** A soy-free alternative that’s naturally sweet and lower in sodium. I like this for a gluten-free marinade that still hits all the right flavor notes. Try my [Paleo Orange Chicken](https://whatgreatgrandmaate.com/paleo-whole30-orange-chicken/) for another soy-free take!)\n*   **Honey:** Just a little for balance.\n*   **Garlic & Green Onion:** Classic aromatics that add depth and brightness.\n*   **Chili Peppers:** Red and green chilis bring color and gentle heat.\n*   **Toasted Sesame Seeds & Sea Salt:** For garnish and flavor layering.\n\n**Prefer traditional?** Use ½ cup regular soy sauce + ½ cup water in place of the coconut aminos and omit the extra salt. You’ll get the classic flavor profile with that rich, salty-sweet punch.\n\nHow to Make Mayak Eggs\n----------------------\n\n![step by step photos showing the process of making mayak eggs: boiling in water, resting in an ice bath, marinating in a dish. ](https://whatgreatgrandmaate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/mayak-eggs-step-by-step.jpg)\n\n**Step 1:** Bring a large pot of water to a boil with a splash of vinegar and a pinch of salt. Gently lower in your eggs and simmer for 6 minutes for soft-boiled. Add 3-5 minutes for hard-boiled.\n\n**Step 2:** Transfer eggs to an ice bath for 5 minutes, then peel carefully.\n\n**Step 3:** In a container just large enough to hold the eggs, stir together coconut aminos, honey, green onion, garlic, chili peppers, sea salt, and sesame seeds.\n\n**Step 4:** Add peeled eggs, making sure they’re mostly submerged in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight.\n\n**Step 5:** Serve over hot rice or cauliflower rice, spooning plenty of marinade on top.

Use ½ cup soy sauce + ½ cup water, and skip the added salt.\n\n****How long should I marinate the eggs?**** \n\n8 hours is enough, but overnight is even better. The longer they sit, the deeper the flavor.\n\n****How long do mayak eggs last in the fridge?**** \n\nThey’re best within 5–7 days, stored in their marinade.\n\n****Can I reuse the marinade?**** \n\nNot for more eggs. But it makes a great drizzle for stir-fries or veggies within 2 days.\n\n****Do I need to peel the eggs before marinating?**** \n\nYes — peeled eggs soak up the marinade more effectively.\n\nIf you make this recipe, please leave me a star rating and comment below!

Store-bought gnocchi can simply be browned in a pan for an exciting mix of crispy outsides and chewy middles, no boiling required. This dish is studded with juicy tomatoes and melty pockets of mozzarella. Cherry tomatoes are reliably more flavorful year-round than larger, more watery varieties like beefsteak and heirloom. (That said, taste yours, and if they’re more tart than sweet, add ½ teaspoon sugar in Step 2.) Toss the tomatoes with browned butter, red-pepper flakes and garlic, then hit them with a little heat, and they’ll burst into a bright sauce.

Here are some tips. Do NOT sear the gnocchi as directed. They will burn. Leave them uncovered and constantly toss them while searing to achieve the \"golden brown\" color. Take the pan OFF the heat when browning the butter. The residual heat will ensure that you don't scorch the butter and the thinly sliced garlic. You can put it back on the heat once the residual heat in the pan abates a bit. Otherwise, a simply stellar dish that is easy and delicious. A \"go-to\" dish.\n\nUse chicken broth instead of water, add your favorite nut for texture (I suggest pine nuts), and a light honey drizzle! It helps the tomato flavor to pop and contrast nicely with the crushed red pepper. Lastly, it mentions garlic in the recipe but does not note it in the ingredients, a tablespoon of minced garlic really will marinate nicely with the tomatoes.\n\nThe best refrigerated gnocchi are by Rana. Always keep a packet of them around in case rice or potatoes won’t do as starch. Their ravioli are also excellent.\n\nI made this tonight and did not like it. However, I blame the cook and the tomatoes. Tomatoes were not good. Very little flavour but the worst thing about them was they had a pithy texture. I had read many comment prior to cooking and intended to add a drizzle of honey but I completely forgot. I think it could have been much tastier than I made, but I don’t think I would have really liked it regardless. I’m glad I made it though because it was my first time making shelf stable, ready to go gnocchi, and it was really delicious fried in olive oil with salt. Really glad I read the comment about frying while constantly stirring until golden brown. Worked really well and no burn.\n\nI added pancetta by cooking it up in the skillet before cooking the gnocchi, and then cooked the first batch of gnocchi with the grease from the pancetta. This worked out great, and added a nice texture and flavor to the dish! Because of the saltiness of the pancetta, I also reduced the amount of salt to 1 tsp.\n\nWould use more tomatoes!!\n\nPrivate comments are only visible to you.\n\n* * *\n\nor to save this recipe.\n\n* * *",

It is best to use pre-made rice that is at least one day old to really soak up the flavors.\n*   **Chickpeas** – are the source of protein for the dish, as well high in vitamins and minerals that support heart health\n*   **Garlic and Shallots** – the aromatics of the dish begin with fresh minced garlic and shallots\n*   **Coconut Shreds** – add a crispy element to the dish while incorporating flavors to heighten the final flavor of the dish\n*   **Ginger** – is used for anti-inflammatory benefit, but also delicious flavor throughout\n*   **Kale** – is one of the most nutrient dense foods you can consume. Not only is kale added for that reason, but also for color and texture difference to the dish\n*   **Canned Coconut Milk** – we are using canned coconut milk for it’s ability to make dishes creamy but yet still dairy free\n*   **Sesame Seeds** – have a great source of protein, healthy fat, and minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants. Don’t let their small size full you! They also offer a great nutty flavor to the dish.\n*   **Spices** – we are also adding, red pepper flakes, turmeric, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the dish to round out the flavors and give added health benefits.\n\nSubstitutions and Variations\n----------------------------\n\n*   **Rice**– you can use freshly made right but will be soggier than using day old rice. Alternatively, you could use another grain like quinoa.\n*   ****Chickpeas** –** we’d recommend replacing chickpeas with a white bean like cannellini or great northern. Otherwise, you could replace with tofu, lentils, edamame, or even mushrooms. These later ingredients won’t crisp up like the chickpeas, so add those after cooking the garlic and shallots.\n*   ****Shallots** –** replace with a yellow or white onion\n*   ****Coconut Shreds** –** could be omitted if you don’t like a strong coconut flavor\n*   ****Kale** –** replace with another leafy green like spinach\n*   ****Canned Coconut Milk** –** if you can’t have or don’t like coconut, we’d recommend swapping with another creamy non-dairy milk like soy or the extra creamy oat milk.\n*   ****Sesame Seeds** –** swap for chia seeds\n\nStep by Step Instructions:\n--------------------------\n\n![A skillet of chickpeas, shallots, garlic and ginger cooking.](https://makeitdairyfree.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/creamy-coconut-rice-and-chickpeas-10.jpg)\n\n![coconut and chickpeas cooking in a skillet. ](https://makeitdairyfree.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/creamy-coconut-rice-and-chickpeas-11.jpg)\n\nStart by adding some oil into a large skillet over medium heat. Then, add chickpeas and half of your shallots and garlic and all of the ginger.\n\nYou’ll want to cook this for about 10 minute or until your chickpeas have started to crispy up. Stirring often so your chickpeas don’t burn.\n\nThen add in coconut flakes, sesame seeds, and red pepper flakes. Stir to combine and let cook for another 2-3 minutes.\n\n**Quick Tip:** For another element of flavor, try adding sweet chili sauce here and stir to combine before taking it off the heat.\n\n![A skillet of shallots, garlic and ginger cooking.](https://makeitdairyfree.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/creamy-coconut-rice-and-chickpeas-12-683x1024.jpg)\n\n![A skillet of uncooked kale, turmeric, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper.](https://makeitdairyfree.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/creamy-coconut-rice-and-chickpeas-13-683x1024.jpg)\n\nRemove your chickpea ingredients onto a plate.\n\nThen, in the same skillet, add the remaining oil (still on medium heat).\n\nOnce heated, add the remaining shallots and garlic.

Swap your sesame seeds for chia seeds or omit. For the coconut shreds and milk, we’d recommend omitting the shreds and swapping the milk for an extra creamy oat milk. You will have to reduce longer if swapping the coconut milk.\n\n**Can I prep this dish ahead of time?**\n\nYes, This dish can be prepared up to 3-4 days in advance. Make sure after making, let cool completely, then store in an air tight container.\n\n**Can I double the recipe?**\n\nYes. Just double all the ingredients listed.\n\n**Why is it best to use day old rice?**\n\nCoconut rice has a tendency to get mushy because of the excess liquid. Two ways that you can prevent mushy coconut rice is because making sure to rinse your rice before cooking and then to use day old rice because it can absorb liquid better. Freshly cooked and warm rice will stay mushy.\n\n![A white bowl of vegan pineapple fried rice.](https://makeitdairyfree.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vegan-pineapple-fried-rice_-4-683x1024.jpg)\n\n**What Other Vegan Rice Dishes Could I Make?**\n\nIf you love fried rice, you’ll love these dishes as well!\n\n*   **[Jamaican Rice and Peas](https://makeitdairyfree.com/vegan-jamaican-rice-and-peas/)**\n*   **[Vegan Chicken Fried Rice](https://makeitdairyfree.com/vegan-chicken-fried-rice/)**\n*   **[Vegan Tex Mex Rice](https://makeitdairyfree.com/vegan-instant-pot-tex-mex-rice/)**\n*   **[Vegan Pineapple Fried Rice](https://makeitdairyfree.com/vegan-pineapple-fried-rice/)**\n*   **[Vegan Dirty Rice](https://makeitdairyfree.com/instant-pot-vegan-dirty-rice/)**\n*   **[Jamaican Jerk Tofu Rice Bowls with Vegetables](https://makeitdairyfree.com/vegan-jerk-tofu-rice-bowls-with-vegetables/)**\n*   **[Vegan Mango Fried Rice](https://makeitdairyfree.com/vegan-mango-fried-rice/)**\n*   **[Vegan Chorizo Fried Rice](https://makeitdairyfree.com/vegan-chorizo-fried-rice/)**\n\n**Pin this easy vegan fried rice for later!**\n\n🥳 Get the Full Recipe\n----------------------\n\n*   ▢ 4 tablespoon [olive oil,](https://amzn.to/2U8QL4L) divided\n*   ▢ 15.5 oz can [chickpeas,](https://amzn.to/2EJAadZ) drained, rinsed and patted dry (439g)\n*   ▢ 2 shallots, thinly sliced, divided\n*   ▢ 6 cloves garlic, minced, divided\n*   ▢ ½ teaspoon [ground ginger](https://amzn.to/3Zvcu7j) (or use ½ tablespoon fresh)\n*   ▢ ½ cup unsweetened coconut flakes (26g)\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoon raw sesame seeds\n*   ▢ ¼ teaspoon [red pepper flakes,](https://amzn.to/2ZjE7jK) optional\n*   ▢ 2 cups kale, chopped (135g)\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon [ground turmeric](https://amzn.to/4dR5ua8)\n*   ▢ ½ teaspoon [garlic powder](https://amzn.to/2VqQuHw)\n*   ▢ ½ teaspoon [sea salt,](https://amzn.to/44t9IBr) more or less to taste\n*   ▢ ¼ teaspoon [black pepper,](https://amzn.to/2YMfoFW) more or less to tate\n*   ▢ 13.5 oz can [full fat coconut milk](https://amzn.to/2yMQGqQ) (400mL)\n*   ▢ 3 cups brown basmati rice, cooked and cooled (day old preferred) (600g)\n*   ▢ 3 stalks green onions, sliced\n\n*   Using a large skillet, add 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat.

Caramelizing onions takes a good half-hour, so save this recipe for when you have a little extra time and company (this recipe serves two). If time permits, you could even prep them ahead in a [slow cooker](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11170-caramelized-onions). Rather than layer the grated Gruyère and the warm caramelized onions in the sandwich, you should stir them together before assembling, which guarantees that the cheese will melt evenly throughout and that each bite will contain the perfect ratio of fragrant cheese to jammy onions. A splash of sherry, red-wine or white-wine vinegar added to the onions balances out the buttery flavors, but a side salad dressed with a tangy mustard vinaigrette would do the trick, too.

Step\n    \n    1\n    \n    In a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add the onions and season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook, stirring once or twice, until the onions are softened, 3 to 5 minutes. Uncover, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. If the onions look dry or like they might burn, add a few tablespoons of water at a time, scraping up any browned bits that are stuck to the bottom of the skillet. If desired, once the onions are done, deglaze the skillet with vinegar and cook until the liquid has evaporated, about 1 minute.

After I harvest onions in the early fall, I set up a table next to my gas grill. I put a big skillet on the side burner, add some oil. I cut up three pounds of so at a time and toss them in the skillet. Doing it on a breezy day keep the tears and smell at bay. After several batches, I let the caramelized onions cool and fill snack size Ziploc bags. Three bags fit into a quart freezer bag. They keep all winter.\n\nA friend pointed this recipe out the other day and it fit the bill for a perfect, Lenten Friday, lunch. The wife approved with double thumbs up. My one tweak: I deglazed the pan with some bourbon. It's something I usually do if I am caramelizing onions. It's adds a nice vanilla sweetness.\n\nMade these with homemade tomato soup and thought they were great. We had leftovers, so I made myself another soup and sandwich, but added some minced fresh dates to the onion and heated them again in a little butter. Wow! The very slight bitterness of onions was transformed. The added specs of sweetness to the combination of crisp bread, silky melted cheese and savory onions elevated this already excellent sandwich to something REALLY special. Give it a try. You’ll like it.\n\nThis is even better than French Onion Soup and you don't have to make beef broth! Will definitely make again.\n\nSlice 3 pounds of onions and 1/2 stick of butter in your crockpot on high for 10 hours. Amazing! Extra goes in the freezer. Then, I made the grilled cheese also, amazing. I thought it needed a little extra salt.\n\nJust didn't work for me. I felt like it needed something to make it a bit tastier so I used cranberry chutney and added a different kind of cheese. Won't make again.\n\nPrivate comments are only visible to you.\n\n* * *\n\nor to save this recipe.\n\n* * *",

The one you get at the end of your nose nearly the second after you start feeding the baby and have not a finger free to scratch it.\n\n[![what you'll need](https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50514329631_c5d416930f_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&ssl=1)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/50514329631/in/photostream \"what you'll need\")\n\nIt’s not always an itch, though. Sometimes it’s a just a bit of water that you need — just a sip! from that glass just two feet in front of you! Oh, how you would do anything for that sip of water! But a lot of times these days, it’s a recipe. I can’t help it. I have so little time to cook and yet these recipe ideas are getting louder and louder in my head… winter salads and tangy pies and buttery leeks and funky salsas and I have more dishes than I could cook in two hundred nap times, it seems, nonetheless in the 15 minutes of a single one that is left after I have both scratched my nose _and_ taken that sweet, sweet sip of water.\n\n[![dice your bread](https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50514494587_7f8079148a_n.jpg?resize=320%2C213&ssl=1)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/50514494587/in/photostream \"dice your bread\")[![toast bread cubes](https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50514328926_f2b38cd81c_n.jpg?resize=320%2C213&ssl=1)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/50514328926/in/photostream \"toast bread cubes\")[![add apples and raisins](https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50514493842_af0616fb7b_n.jpg?resize=320%2C213&ssl=1)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/50514493842/in/photostream \"add apples and raisins\")[![make custard](https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50514494437_65d2435861_n.jpg?resize=320%2C213&ssl=1)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/50514494437/in/photostream \"make custard\")[![add the egg mixture](https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50514493667_390f6be795_n.jpg?resize=320%2C213&ssl=1)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/50514493667/in/photostream \"add the egg mixture\")[![ready to bake](https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50513615188_ab9d9cb585_n.jpg?resize=320%2C213&ssl=1)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/50513615188/in/photostream \"ready to bake\")\n\nSo, I keep a list. I jot all of these ideas down and I arrange them according to urgency and to keep myself sane, I only look at the top item at any one time and try to plot my course accordingly. A couple weeks ago, it was a faintly gingerbread-spiced bread pudding with chunks of apples, studded with plumped raisins and on our next trip to the market, I bought some apples and on another trip, Alex bought some raisins and we hit up one of those Ukrainian restaurants in our neighborhood for some of their homemade challah and on another run I remembered to buy some milk and eggs and finally, 9 days and 14 hours and 26 minutes (or so) after I had started dreaming of a fall bread pudding that could be dessert or decadent breakfast or just something to make our apartment smell so ungodly awesome, [it even mesmerizes its tiniest inhabitant](http://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/4092935362/), I had this one in front of me.\n\nAnd — thank god — it was totally worth the wait.\n\n[![raisin-studded apple bread pudding](https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/50514493237_ccba493ec3_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&ssl=1)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/50514493237/in/photostream \"raisin-studded apple bread pudding\")\n\n##### Previously\n\n**One year ago:** [Cauliflower Salad with Green Olives and Capers](http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/11/cauliflower-salad-with-green-olives-and-capers/), [Onion Tart with Mustard and Fennel](http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/11/onion-tart-with-mustard-and-fennel/) and [Silky Smooth Pumpkin Pie](http://smittenkitchen.com/2008/11/silky-smooth-pumpkin-pie/)  \n**Two years ago:** [Simplest Apple Tart](http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/11/simplest-apple-tart/) and [Black Bean Pumpkin Soup](http://smittenkitchen.com/2007/11/black-bean-pumkin-soup/)  \n**Three years ago:** [Shrimp Cocktail](http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/11/when-the-stars-make-you-drool/), [Artichoke Potato Gratin](http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/11/when-the-stars-make-you-drool/), [Chocolate Stout Cake](http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/11/ganached-guinness-goodness/) and [Couscous and Feta-Stuffed Peppers](http://smittenkitchen.com/2006/11/also-i-once-color-sorted-my-books/)\n\n### Raisin-Studded Apple Bread Pudding\n\nRecipe notes: When I first made this in 2009, I did away with the separating eggs in the original recipe. I noted that you could add another egg and cup of milk if you’d like an eggier custard, but I rarely do this with a sweet, rich bread such as the challah shown here; it’s not needed. These days, in this 2020 update, I make several additional changes. I double the cinnamon (adjusted below from 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon), use a little less sugar (heaped 1/2 cup) when I’m using a sweet bread like challah and the full amount with a regular white bread, halve the raisins (using 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup), don’t plump them unless they’re hard, don’t bother heating the milk and molasses, and assemble everything in the baking dish, not a bowl. I do not remove the bread crusts (especially with challah), and I like to toast the almonds before I begin or they stay pale in the oven. Finally, I often make this the night before I need it and let it soak in the fridge overnight; I bake it cold from the fridge, to serve it warm.\n\n*   1 pound bakery white or challah bread, crusts removed if you wish, cut into 1-inch cubes\n*   1 Granny Smith apple, peeled, cored and cut into 1/2-inch pieces\n*   1/2 to 1 cup golden raisins, plumped in hot water for 15 minutes, if necessary (see Note)\n*   3 large eggs\n*   Heaped 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup granulated sugar (see Note)\n*   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n*   1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg\n*   1/8 teaspoon ground ginger\n*   1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n*   1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt\n*   3 cups whole milk\n*   2 tablespoons molasses\n*   1/4 cup toasted, sliced almonds\n\nHeat the oven to 350°F. Generously butter either a 9×13-inch deep baking dish or six 8-ounce ramekins. If using ramekins, set them on a baking sheet.\n\nSpread the bread cubes on a large baking sheet and toast in the oven for 6 minutes, until crisp. Transfer to baking dish(es). Add the apples and raisin and toss gently to combine.\n\nIn a medium bowl, using a handheld electric mixer or whisk, beat the eggs with the sugar, spices, vanilla, salt, and molasses. Gradually add milk, beating well. Pour the custard over the bread mixture, nudging the bread around a bit to make sure it soaks all of the pieces. Let stand for 5 minutes at room temperature (minimum) or overnight in the fridge, covered tightly.\n\nSprinkle the almonds on top before baking. Bake in the center of the oven for about 40 minutes (and up to 50 minutes if cold from fridge), until puffed and set, with the tops lightly browned. Let the bread pudding(s) rest for at least 15 minutes before serving.\n\n  \n\nPost navigation\n---------------",

Of course, if you prefer, go a head and pot the cooked kugel in the oven or in the air fryer and brown the top.\n\n![Soak Raisins in Water to Plump](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20160708_192620.jpg \"Soak Raisins in Water to Plump Image\")\n\nSoak Raisins in Water to Plump\n\nWhy Soak Raisins?\n-----------------\n\n*   Soaking raisins will plump them up and keep them from being very chewy.\n*   The texture after cooking is much better.\n\nIf you do not want to soak the raisins, you do not have too. This is just a personal preference.\n\nBoth [Black Raisins](http://amzn.to/2j7LtCn) or [Golden Raisins](http://amzn.to/2kBDeic) can be used at the same time. Other types of dried fruit can be used too!\n\n**Pro Tip:** For an interesting twist, soak the raisins (or whichever dry fruit you are using) in some brandy instead of water.\n\nVarious Dried Fruit To Use\n--------------------------\n\n*   [Diced Mix Fruit](https://amzn.to/3oWIJsD)\n*   [Fruit Cake Fruit](http://amzn.to/2bmlqTV)\n*   [Craisins Dried Cranberries](https://amzn.to/2LsDCh9)\n*   Diced Apples\n*   Diced Pineapples\n*   [Dried Apricots](https://amzn.to/3vfPmId), chopped\n*   [Sun Dried Fruit Medley](https://amzn.to/3oWIJsD) is really nice to use. It adds color and the combination of the dried fruit is super tasty.\n\nWhichever dried fruit you choose to use, the first thing is to soak the fruit/raisins in fresh water. The raisins will plump and be nice in the kugel as opposed to chewy and hard from baking.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Don’t use candied fruit (you know, the kind you would use for a [Christmas Holiday Fruitcake](https://thisoldgal.com/pressure-cooker-three-ingredient-holiday-fruitcake/)) when making kugel. It will be way too sweet.\n\n[![Add the pasta to the Instant Pot or Pressure Cooker](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160817_141152.jpg \"Add the pasta to the Instant Pot or Pressure Cooker Image\")](https://amzn.to/3edKE8g)\n\nAdd the pasta to the Instant Pot or Pressure Cooker\n\nThe egg noodles will cook super fast, so don’t leave the kitchen.\n\nTo avoid the sputtering that sometimes happens when doing a quick release, use short, intermittent movements to release a little steam at a time.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Running the cooked noodles under cold water will stop the cooking process. They need to be al dente since they are going back into the pressure cooker.\n\nLower Carb Option for Noodle Kugel\n----------------------------------\n\nDiabetics and those watching their carbohydrate and sugar intake, you could make a more diabetic friendly option.\n\n*   Use [Miracle Noodles](http://amzn.to/2C10YVo). instead of pasta\n*   Use a [Sugar Substitute](http://bit.ly/2WfOsPd) in place of white sugar\n*   Swap the raisins out for diced peeled zucchini\n\n**Pro Tip:** Cottage cheese still has some carbs, so please check the nutrition and eat according to your personal requirements.\n\n![Beat Six Eggs Well](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20160708_193002.jpg \"Beat Six Eggs Well Image\")\n\nBeat Six Eggs Well\n\nI use a [Cuisinart Electric Hand Mixer](https://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KHM512ER-5-Speed-Ultra-Empire/dp/B009VUHLHA?tag=tog00-20) as it is so easy to just mix all the ingredients together and get them blended really well.\n\nFor all you who love to beat your eggs hard in my [Pressure Cooker New York Cheesecake](https://thisoldgal.com/pressure-cooker-new-york-cheesecake/) recipe, which you shouldn’t, here is your chance!! Hahahahaha.\n\n![Dump in Filling Ingredients](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20160708_194344.jpg \"Dump in Filling Ingredients Image\")\n\nDump in Filling Ingredients\n\nAdd in the cottage cheese, sour cream, [cinnamon](https://www.amazon.com/Simply-Organic-Certified-2-45-Ounce-Container/dp/B000WS1KHM?tag=tog00-20), [sugar](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CJ8I9MC/US/tog00-20/?tag=tog00-20), [lemon juice](https://www.amazon.com/Realemon-100emon-Juice-15/dp/B007F1LWWC?tag=tog00-20) and the rest of the ingredients to the [Large Mixing Bowl](https://amzn.to/2GLXZ4U) and [beat](https://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KHM512ER-5-Speed-Ultra-Empire/dp/B009VUHLHA?tag=tog00-20) it really well so that there are no chunks of cottage cheese.\n\n![Beat the filing until smooth!](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20160708_194609.jpg \"Beat the filing until smooth! Image\")\n\nBeat the filing until smooth!\n\nYou will want a nice and smooth consistency.\n\n![Drain Noodles, Rinse under Cold Water](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20160708_194023.jpg)\n\nDrain Noodles, Rinse under Cold Water\n\nBy this time the noodles should be finished cooking. Drain the water and run the noodles under cold water.\n\n![Dump in the Egg Noodles into Filling Mixture](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20160708_194645.jpg)\n\nDump in the Egg Noodles into Filling Mixture\n\nGently fold the noodles into the [Large Mixing Bowl](https://amzn.to/2GLXZ4U) with the cottage cheese mixture and combine well.\n\n![Gently make sure all noodles are coated with the luscious filling](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20160708_194740.jpg \"Gently make sure all noodles are coated with the luscious filling Image\")\n\nGently make sure all noodles are coated with the luscious filling\n\nCan Other Noodles Be Used?\n--------------------------\n\n*   Yes. Very often when I make Pressure Cooker Jewish Noodle Kugel, I’ll use various shapes of pasta. For Chanukkah, I have used pasta shaped like dreidels and [Star of David/Jewish Star Pasta](https://amzn.to/3vibK4m).\n*   For Christmas (oh, you would be surprised at how popular this kugel is at Christmas pot lucks) I use pasta in the shape of [Christmas Trees](https://amzn.to/3fmvaQ2). This ALWAYS goes over really well!\n*   [Heart Shaped Pasta](https://amzn.to/35gc3RO) is super nice too!\n*   You can even use plain old [Spaghetti Noodles](http://amzn.to/2B6Ak08) which are always fun to use.\n\nAnother wonderful recipe to bring to a potluck is my [Chocolate Chip Coffee Cake](https://thisoldgal.com/chocolate-chip-coffee-cake/), which is to die for…..really!\n\n![Drained Raisins](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20160708_194827.jpg \"Drained Raisins Image\")\n\nDrained Raisins\n\nThere are other fruit variations too. Using canned and fresh fruit gives the Instant Pot Jewish Noodle Kugel a different texture. Dried fruit has a chew to it, but fresh and canned fruit will generally blend in with the cheese mixture. It kinds of reminds me a fruit blintz.\n\nFresh and Canned Fruit Options\n------------------------------\n\n*   [Crushed Pineapple](https://amzn.to/2RUE5iS)\n*   Diced Granny Smith Apples are super nice\n*   Fresh or [Canned Apricot](https://amzn.to/3vlasVw)\n\n**Pro Tip:** Fresh and canned fruit may not be as sweet and the sweetness (sugar) may need to be adjusted.\n\n![Gently fold in the raisins Noodle Pudding](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160818_163133.jpg)\n\nGently fold in the raisins\n\nKugel is a Jewish dish, but so many of my friends who are not Jewish, use this dish for Christmas dinner. I have seen them use [Santa shaped pasta](https://www.amazon.com/Santas-Workshop-Novelty-Pasta-Package/dp/B017DIVOJ2?tag=tog00-20) and [cranberries](https://www.amazon.com/Ocean-Spray-Craisins-Cranberry-Ounce/dp/B00OAEVSTY?tag=tog00-20)!\n\n![Pour half the mixture into the Push Pan](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160818_163500.jpg \"Pour half the mixture into the Push Pan Image\")\n\nPour half the mixture into the Push Pan\n\nGenerously, butter your [Push Pan](https://amzn.to/2YH0stn) so that the kugel will easily release.\n\nSince the posting of this recipe, I have switched to using this [cake push pan with handles](https://amzn.to/2YH0stn). It makes is to easy to get the pan in and out of the pressure cooker.\n\n**Pro Tip**: DO NOT USE PARCHMENT ROUNDS for the Kugel. While [Parchment Rounds](https://www.amazon.com/Worthy-Liners-Parchment-Paper-Round/dp/B00OWZXFP6?tag=tog00-20) are great when making [cheesecake](https://thisoldgal.com/perfect-pressure-cooker-cheesecake-tips/), it is not for making Kugel, as it will adhere and become one with the Kugel. Trust me on this! Don’t do it.\n\n[![Pressure Cooker Jewish Noodle Kugel](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160818_174303.jpg \"Pressure Cooker Jewish Noodle Kugel Image\")](https://www.amazon.com/Fat-Daddios-Anodized-Aluminum-Cheesecake/dp/B0012Q5QQ4?tag=tog00-20)\n\nPressure Cooker Jewish Noodle Kugel\n\nThis is how the noodle kugel looks right out of the pressure cooker. Because I love the crispy top, here is what you do to make it nice and brown and crispy as if baked in the oven.\n\n![Place the CrispLid on top of the Instant Pot](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Instant-Pot-Poor-Mans-Burnt-Ends-20.jpg \"Place the CrispLid on top of the Instant Pot\")\n\nPlace the CrispLid on top of the Instant Pot\n\nAfter the Instant Pot Noodle Kugel is “baked” you will want to give the top a nice browning so that some of the noodles turn brown. The crispy part on top is the best! If you want the cornflake topping, add it now and then brown the top. If not using the cornflake topping, still, brown the top!\n\nBrowning the Top\n----------------\n\n*   Use a temperature of 350 degrees and place your Crisping Lid on top. Keep an eye on it, so that the kugel does not burn.\n*   I recommend either of these two Crisping Lids:\n    *   [Mealthy CrispLid](https://amzn.to/33D9zK0) (buy from Amazon)\n    *   [Instant Pot Crisping Lid](https://amzn.to/2sZeush) (buy from Amazon)\n\n[![Crisped Up Pressure Cooker Jewish Kugel](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160818_175346.jpg \"Crisped Up Pressure Cooker Jewish Kugel Image\")](https://www.amazon.com/Fat-Daddios-Anodized-Aluminum-Cheesecake/dp/B0012Q5QQ4?tag=tog00-20)\n\nCrisped Up Pressure Cooker Jewish Kugel\n\nAlternatively, you can put the Instant Pot Noodle Kugel under the broiler or use an air fryer to broth the top.\n\nMy preference is not adding the cornflake topping, but most people LOVE the topping, so try it both ways and see which you prefer.\n\nClearly, Instant Pot Jewish Noodle Kugel looks better after browning\n\n[![Removing the Pressure Cooker Jewish Noodle Kugel](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160818_195637-1.jpg \"Removing the Pressure Cooker Jewish Noodle Kugel Image\")](https://www.amazon.com/Fat-Daddios-Anodized-Aluminum-Cheesecake/dp/B0012Q5QQ4?tag=tog00-20)\n\nRemoving the Pressure Cooker Jewish Noodle Kugel\n\nHow to Eat Jewish Noodle Kugel\n------------------------------\n\n*   My favorite way to eat Kugel, is at room temperature. You certainly can serve it directly from the [Instant Pot or Pressure Cooker](https://amzn.to/3edKE8g), if you like, but I suggest allowing it to get to room temperate.\n\n**Pro Tip:** You can also make Kugel the day before and refrigerate it to serve with your meal.\n\nHow to Remove Kugel from Pan\n----------------------------\n\n*   Before removing the sides from the Kugel, allow it to set up a while, about an hour. It may be fine to remove the pan right away; I just never tried, so I can’t speak to that…..\n*   Take any can or jar and place the [Push Pan](https://amzn.to/2YH0stn) on top and pull the ring down. The Kugel will appear like magic. I use a really [Thin Slotted Turner](https://www.amazon.com/Lamson-Slotted-Turner-Stainless-Riveted/dp/B00004WGUM?tag=tog00-20) to remove the Kugel off the bottom of the [Push Pan](https://amzn.to/2YH0stn) and on to a plate.\n\n![Yummy Pressure Cooker Jewish Noodle Kugel](https://thisoldgal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20160818_200347.jpg)\n\nYummy Pressure Cooker Jewish Noodle Kugel\n\nYummy Instant Pot Noodle Kugel can be served hot, warm, room temperature or cold. My favorite way is room temperature. For those who do not keep Kosher, but love Jewish food, Instant Pot Kugel goes great with my [Friday Night Shabbos Brisket](https://thisoldgal.com/pressure-cooker-friday-night-shabbos-brisket/).\n\nBring Instant Pot Noodle Kugel to a buffets or to a BBQ. It is also great as desert or just for a snack. It is a great “make a head” dish!\n\nBesides brisket, Kugel goes really well with [London Broil](https://thisoldgal.com/grilled-london-broil/) or [Grilled Tri-Tip!](https://thisoldgal.com/santa-maria-style-barbecue-grilled-tri-tip/)  Enjoy.\n\nMore Jewish Recipes to Make:\n----------------------------\n\n*   [Air Fryer Chanukkah Latkes](https://thisoldgal.com/air-fryer-chanukkah-latkes/) are totally yummy\n*   For bites, try my [Air Fryer Potato Latke Bites](https://thisoldgal.com/air-fryer-potato-latkes-bites/).\n*   [Pressure Cooker Jewish Sweet and Sour Stuffed Cabbage Holishkes](https://thisoldgal.com/pressure-cooker-jewish-sweet-and-sour-stuffed-cabbage/)\n*   [Pressure Cooker Friday Night Shabbos Brisket.](https://thisoldgal.com/pressure-cooker-friday-night-shabbos-brisket/)\n\nKitchen Equipment and Essentials\n--------------------------------\n\n*   [Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3edKE8g), [Ninja Foodi](https://amzn.to/3ekYPIU) or [Pressure Cooker](https://amzn.to/3ekYPIU)\n*   [Instant Pot Crisping Lid](https://amzn.to/2sZeush) or [Mealthy CrispLid](https://amzn.to/2wvw2Ko) (buy from Mealthy) / [Mealthy CrispLid](https://amzn.to/33D9zK0) (buy from Amazon)\n*   [di Oro Living Silicone Spatulas Set](https://www.amazon.com/ORO-Heat-Resistant-Pro-Grade-Reinforced-Technology/dp/B00GWVRW3Y?tag=tog00-20)\n*   [Porcelain & Bamboo Salt Box with Spoon](https://www.amazon.com/Dash-Bleu-Countertop-Ceramic-Bamboo/dp/B00Y92DVFG?tag=tog00-20)\n*   [Salbree Steamer Basket](https://amzn.to/2VZkV8y)\n*   [3.5 Quart Stainless Steel Mixing Bowl](https://amzn.to/2GLXZ4U)\n*   [Cuisinart Electric Hand Mixer](https://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KHM512ER-5-Speed-Ultra-Empire/dp/B009VUHLHA?tag=tog00-20)\n*   [Cake Push Pan with Egg Bite Molds Set](https://amzn.to/2YH0stn)\n\n**_Caring is sharing_**_!

Set aside.\n    \n\n#### Filling\n\n*   Beat or whisk eggs.  Add cottage cheese, sour cream, sugar, cinnamon, salt, lemon juice and beat well.  Fold cooked noodles into mixture.\n    \n*   Drain water from raisins and fold into mixture.\n    \n*   Generously grease your Push Pan,  Pour noodle mixture into Push Pan and dot with butter.\n    \n*   Add 1.5 cups of water to Pressure Cooker cooking pot and place in a trivet.  Place Kugel on top of trivet.\n    \n*   Lock on Lid and close Pressure Valve.  Cook at High Pressure for 20 minutes.\n    \n*   When Beep sounds, allow a 15 minute Natural Pressure Release.\n    \n*   Open lid and if using topping, add it now.\n    \n*   Place Mealthy Crisplid on top of pressure cooker.

It adds color and the combination of the dried fruit is super tasty.\n\nRunning cold water over the cooked noodles will stop the cooking process, so that the noodles do not become over cooked during pressure cooking of the kugel.\n\nAfter the Instant Pot Noodle Kugel is \"baked\" you will want to give the top a nice browning so that some of the noodles turn brown. The crispy part on top is the best! If you want the cornflake topping, add it now and then brown the top. If not using the cornflake topping, still, brown the top!\n\n### Browning the Top\n\n*   Use a temperature of 350 degrees and place your Crisping Lid on top. Keep an eye on it, so that the kugel does not burn.\n*   I recommend these two Crisping Lids:\n    *   [Mealthy CrispLid](https://amzn.to/33D9zK0) (buy from Amazon)\n    *   [Instant Pot Crisping Lid](https://amzn.to/2sZeush) (buy from Amazon)\n\nAny type of pasta or semolina noodle is fine to use in this recipe. If using a different shape of pasta or noodle, your cook time will be different.  I particularly like to use spaghetti noodles and use a [9 Inch Springform Pan](https://amzn.to/3hmIFhk)! It is really pretty when you cut into the kugel.\n\n### Macaroni and Noodle Options\n\n*   [Spaghetti Noodles](http://amzn.to/2B6Ak08) are always fun to use.\n*   [Star of David/Jewish Star Pasta](https://amzn.to/3vibK4m)\n*   [Christmas Tree Pasta](https://amzn.to/3fmvaQ2) - I like to use this for office holiday parties. When I do, I use the tree pasta with cranberries, making it very festive\n*   [Gingerbread Man Shaped Macaroni](https://amzn.to/3fKeQYl)\n*   [Bunny Shaped Pasta](https://amzn.to/34k0d8J)\n\n### This Old Gal's Pasta Rule of Thumb\n\n*   Look at package of pasta and find the variable cook time. Choose the lesser time given and then subtract 2 minutes. For example, if your package of pasta says \"cook for 8 - 11 minutes,\" take that 8 minute number and cut it in half, which is 4. Then subtract 2 minutes from the 4 minutes and you will end up with the proper cook time. In this example the cook time will be 2 minutes.\n*   After the 2 minute pressure cook time is up, wait 5 minutes and then release the rest of the pressure.\n*   If the variable cook time on your package of pasta is 11 - 16 minutes, err on the lesser side. In this instance, the cook time would be 3 minutes. It is better to end up with overly firm pasta rather than mushy because you can continue to cook the pasta, but if it is mushy, there is nothing you can do to correct.\n*   If the pasta is too firm or al dente for your taste, simply put the lid back on the pot and let the pasta sit in the hot pot.  The residual heat will continue to cook the pasta. Check after a few minutes to see if the pasta has reached the perfect firmness for your liking. If not give it a stir and let sit some more.\n\nThis recipe uses a bit of a natural release and the total time is figured into that, so only the cook time needs to be adjusted.

Frozen sweet potatoes and collard greens keep the prep to a minimum, but if you have a little extra time on your hands, fresh veggies work just as well.

  "https://bewitchingkitchen.com/tag/thomas-keller-cauliflower-soup/": "\n\n> **Scraped from [Bewitching Kitchen](https://bewitchingkitchen.com/tag/thomas-keller-cauliflower-soup/)**\n\nThis is the first recipe I cooked from Thomas Keller’s new book “[Ad Hoc](https://bewitchingkitchen.wordpress.com/2009/10/15/new-cookbook-in-the-house/)“.  He calls it “_Cream of Cauliflower Soup with Red Beet Chips_.” Fair enough, but I wish the name was a bit more catchy, because the recipe sure deserves it.  😉  \n[![plate2](https://bewitchingkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/plate2.jpg?w=640 \"plate2\")](https://bewitchingkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/plate2.jpg)\n\nI’ve made many types of cauliflower soup, from simple versions (cauliflower, onions and water) to involved interpretations in which the cauliflower is first roasted, then paired with different spices, truffle oil, etc…. you get the picture.\n\nThomas Keller’s recipe takes the soup to a new level. Not only because the red chips refine its look, but because it also _tastes_ refined. You’ll swoon over the first spoonful, and then wonder if any other mix of flavors could work so well together.\n\n**CREAM OF CAULIFLOWER SOUP with RED BEET CHIPS**  \n_(adapted from Keller’s “Ad Hoc”)_\n\n1 head of cauliflower  \n2 T butter  \n3/4 cup chopped yellow onions  \n1/8 tsp curry powder (I used hot curry from Penzey’s)  \nkosher salt  \n1 cup milk  \n1/2 cup heavy cream  \n2 + 1/2 cups water  \npeanut oil for frying beet chips  \n1 beet  \n1 tsp white vinegar  \nextra virgin olive oil  \nblack pepper, freshly ground\n\n_Make the soup…._  \nRemove the leaves and core of the cauliflower, separate about 1 cup of good-looking florets, not larger than a quarter, and reserve them.  Chop the rest of the cauliflower in chunks of similar size.  Melt 1.5 T of butter in a large saucepan, add the chopped onions, curry powder, and cauliflower, sprinkle 1 tsp salt, and cover the whole mixture with parchment paper, making a “false lid” right on top of the cauliflower.  Cover the saucepan with its regular lid, cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the cauliflower starts to get tender.\n\nRemove the parchment paper, add milk, cream, and water to the pan, and simmer, skimming the foam every now and then, for 30 minutes. Carefully transfer the mixture to a blender (I did it in three batches), and blend until fully smooth.  Adjust the seasoning.\n\n_Make the red beet chips…._  \nPeel the beet (wear gloves) and make paper-thin slices using a mandoline. Ideally, you want to use only nice, full circles (good luck!).  Heat the peanut oil (about 1 inch of oil in a deep pan), and once it is hot but not smoking, add a few beet rounds. Fry them until they stop bubbling hard, it should take a little over 1 minute. Place them on a baking sheet over paper towels, seasoning with a little salt right after frying.  If needed, keep them warm in a 200F oven.\n\n_Cook the reserved florets…._  \nBring some salted water to a boil, add the teaspoon of vinegar, and cook the reserved florets until tender, about 5 minutes.  Drain them.  Right before serving, melt the remaining 1/2 T butter in a small pan and allow it to get dark golden. Watch it carefully, because burned butter is nasty, and tastes bitter. Once the butter is turning a nice golden brown, add the florets and saute them until golden too.\n\n_Serve the soup…._  \nIf the soup is too thick, thin it with a little water.  Ladle it into a bowl, add some cauliflower florets in the center, and a few beet chips on top.  Serve more florets and chips alongside.  \n**  \nENJOY!**\n\nto print the recipe, click **[here](https://bewitchingkitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/caulibeet.pdf).**\n\n_Comments:_ My only modifications were to slightly reduce the amount of heavy cream, and omit the croutons called for in the original recipe. Keller recommends serving a few chips on the soup itself, and the rest on a separate plate, because they may get soggy. I actually didn’t find that a problem: they released a bit of red juice into the velvety soup, creating a nice visual appeal, and they weren’t soggy to the point of losing their texture.\n\nYou’ll notice that he uses a false parchment lid over the veggies, an important step.  The dish has little liquid at that point, basically only some moisture released by the onions – by using the parchment “lid”, you lock the moisture in, and at the same time the curry becomes nicely toasted and permeates the cauliflower more efficiently.\n\nMaking the beet chips was an adventure… The book shows a photo of Thomas Keller in a pristine looking kitchen, with perfect rounds of chips resting on a baking sheet, well organized in perfect rows. It made me feel… let’s say…. a _little_ inadequate…   My kitchen looked like the set of a horror movie, red beet juice everywhere, and carbonized chips begging for the trash can to end their misery.  Oh, well – at least I managed to get enough chips to serve to the two of us.\n\nThis is a classy soup, so if you are into _soup shots_ to open a dinner party, it could be a fine option.\n\n[para receita em portugues, veja a proxima pagina](https://bewitchingkitchen.com/2009/10/21/cauliflower-soup-all-dressed-up/#more-2328)",

It is deliciously warm and comforting, and incredibly easy to make. \n\nWith just 11 ingredients—most of which you probably already have in your kitchen (stock, water, white pepper, sesame oil, salt), you can make a tasty tofu soup that’s actually both flavorful and filling! \n\nTofu & Napa Cabbage: A Winter Pairing\n-------------------------------------\n\nNapa cabbage and tofu are a great duo in Chinese cuisine, as they are often showcased together in winter meals. These two ingredients bring out the best in each other.  \n\nNapa cabbage is a hardy vegetable that can survive throughout winter. Moreover, its natural sweetness intensifies in the colder months. (Hardy vegetables develop sugars to resist frost.)\n\nYou can try it in some of our other napa cabbage recipes, like our [Sichuan Napa Cabbage](https://thewoksoflife.com/hot-sour-cabbage-stir-fry/), [Rice Cakes with Napa Cabbage & Pork](https://thewoksoflife.com/rice-cakes-napa-cabbage-pork/), and [Pork Cabbage Potstickers](https://thewoksoflife.com/easiest-pork-and-cabbage-potstickers-ever/). \n\nFor this soup, I like to cook the cabbage for a long time. The longer it cooks, the more flavorful it gets. \n\nTofu is another year-round staple. Admittedly, using the two of them in soups is nothing new. (See our [Fish Tofu Soup](https://thewoksoflife.com/easy-fish-tofu-soup/)). But the combination just works. The soft tofu and tender napa leaves are a great textural pairing as well.  \n\nMore supermarkets are carrying napa cabbage these days, so this nourishing soup can be yours in a flash! If you have leftovers, all the better. This soup, like many others, tastes better the next day. \n\n![tofu soup ingredients](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tofu-soup.jpg)\n\nFried Eggs in Soup?\n-------------------\n\nPerhaps the most exciting technique in this soup is that of adding fried eggs to it. This is an idea that I have seen in several recipes on the Chinese internet. \n\nAdding eggs to soup is very common in Chinese cooking, but those eggs are usually added while still raw, as in [Egg Drop Soup](https://thewoksoflife.com/egg-drop-soup/), [Hot & Sour Soup](https://thewoksoflife.com/hot-sour-soup/), [Tomato Egg Noodle Soup](https://thewoksoflife.com/tomato-egg-drop-noodle-soup/), West Lake Soup (recipe in [our cookbook](https://thewoksoflife.com/the-woks-of-life-cookbook-now-available/)!), or banquet-style seafood soups. \n\nAdding them after frying them in a wok or pan first, however, keeps the soup brothy rather than thick, and also gives you bigger chunks of egg in the soup, similar to chunks of meat or seafood. The result is hearty and satisfying—and easy! \n\n![](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/asterisk-light.svg)\n\n### Another Secret:\n\nAnother key step in this soup? Keeping it at a rapid boil for 10 minutes, to achieve a milky broth, similar to a ramen broth!\n\nWhile there are many tofu soups out there, we hope you enjoy this version.\n\n![Tofu Soup Recipe](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tofu-soup-14.jpg)\n\n![](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/asterisk-light.svg)\n\n### Make this soup vegetarian\n\nThis recipe can easily be made vegetarian simply by substituting our [Asian Vegetable Stock](https://thewoksoflife.com/asian-vegetable-stock/)—or your preferred vegetable stock—for the chicken stock.\n\nTofu Soup Recipe Instructions\n-----------------------------\n\nIn a pot, bring the chicken stock and water to a boil. Once boiling, cover, and lower the heat to keep it simmering.\n\n![stock and water simmering](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tofu-soup-2.jpg)\n\nMeanwhile, place a medium soup pot or wok over medium-high heat until it’s hot enough that a small splash of water beads and dances along the cooking surface. (See our post on [how to prevent sticking](https://thewoksoflife.com/keep-food-from-sticking-wok-pan/)). \n\nOnce hot, add the oil to coat the bottom of the pot. Crack the eggs into the pot, and cook over medium-high heat until the eggs are browned around the edges (it is important to brown the egg well).\n\n![eggs frying in pot](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tofu-soup-3.jpg)\n\n**Note that the original recipe had 4 eggs, as pictured above, but after some internal discussion decided that 3 eggs is better!**\n\nFlip the eggs over and do the same to the other side, making sure the eggs are cooked through completely. (Runny yolk will cloud the soup.) \n\n![browned fried eggs in pot](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tofu-soup-4.jpg)\n\n![fried eggs in pot](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tofu-soup-5.jpg)\n\nTransfer the fried eggs onto a cutting board and cut into bite-size pieces. Return the egg pieces to the pot.\n\n![bite size pieces of fried egg in pot](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tofu-soup-6.jpg)\n\nIncrease the heat to high, and pour in the simmering stock/water, along with tofu and mushrooms (We used beech mushrooms, AKA bunashimeji mushrooms, but you can use oyster, button, cremini, shiitake—whatever mushroom you have on hand).\n\n![pouring stock into pot with eggs](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tofu-soup-8.jpg)\n\n![adding tofu to pot of soup](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tofu-soup-9.jpg)\n\n![mushrooms in soup pot](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tofu-soup-10.jpg)\n\nCover and boil for 10 minutes over high heat. This will give the soup a rich milky appearance, similar to ramen broth:\n\n![tofu, egg, and mushroom in soup](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tofu-soup-11.jpg)\n\nNext, add the napa cabbage.\n\n![napa cabbage added to soup pot](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tofu-soup-12.jpg)\n\nCover and cook for another 5-10 minutes, or until the cabbage is very tender. Add the sesame oil, salt to taste, and white pepper.\n\nTop with cilantro and/or scallion.\n\n![adding cilantro to tofu soup](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tofu-soup-13.jpg)\n\nServe!\n\n![Scoop of Tofu Soup](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tofu-soup-19.jpg)\n\n![](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tofu-soup-15.jpg)\n\n![Tofu Soup with napa cabbage, mushrooms, and eggs](https://thewoksoflife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tofu-soup-18.jpg)\n\nRecipe\n------\n\nPrep: 10 minutes\n\nCook: 35 minutes\n\nTotal: 45 minutes\n\n*   ▢ 4 cups [chicken stock](https://thewoksoflife.com/homemade-chicken-stock/) (or vegetable stock)\n*   ▢ 3 cups water\n*   ▢ 2 tablespoons neutral oil (such as canola, vegetable, or avocado oil)\n*   ▢ 3 large eggs\n*   ▢ 1 pound soft tofu or silken tofu (1 block, cut into ½-inch/1.25cm) cubes)\n*   ▢ 3 ounces fresh mushrooms (such as button, cremini, beech, oyster, or shiitake, sliced or torn into bite-size pieces)\n*   ▢ 12 ounces [napa cabbage](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-vegetables-asian-leafy-greens/#napa-cabbage) (leaves separated and sliced into ¾-inch/2cm pieces)\n*   ▢ 1 teaspoon [sesame oil](https://thewoksoflife.com/sesame-oil/)\n*   ▢ [Salt](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-spices-condiments/#salt) (to taste)\n*   ▢ ½ teaspoon [white pepper](https://thewoksoflife.com/what-is-white-pepper/)\n*   ▢ ¼ cup [chopped cilantro leaves](https://thewoksoflife.com/chinese-chives-scallions-aromatics-peppers/#cilantro) (and/or scallions)\n\n*   In a pot, bring the chicken stock and water to a boil.

  "https://feedmephoebe.com/wprm_print/the-best-passover-brisket": "\n\n> **Scraped from [Original Source](https://feedmephoebe.com/wprm_print/the-best-passover-brisket)**\n\nThis baked brisket recipe with onions and tomatoes is perfect for any Jewish holiday, but it has been at the center of our Passover table for generations. I’ve been making this version inspired by Emeril’s beef brisket for my Seder table, and can truly say it is the best Passover brisket you will ever eat.\n\nStuffing the meat with garlic cloves and the homemade caramelized onions (none of that soup mix business, here) are what make this brisket special.\n\n*   Preheat the oven to 500°F.\n    \n*   Place the brisket on a work surface. If the fat cap is on the thicker side (1/2 inch) trip off a little of the fat, leaving an even 1/4 -inch layer.\n    \n*   Using a paring knife, make vertical incisions in the meat and shove a piece of garlic into each. Do this until the meat is stuffed with garlic all over. Season both sides with salt and pepper and place the brisket in a large braiser, Dutch oven or rimmed baking dish (preferably metal) starting with the fat cap facing up and brown it in the oven, about 10 minutes per side.\n    \n*   Remove the pan from the oven, and pour in the beef stock (NOTE: if you are using a pyrex dish, wait a few minutes for the pan to acclimate to room temperature so it does not shatter.). Turn the oven down to 350 degrees, cover the dish with a lid or foil, and cook in the oven for 1 hour.\n    \n*   In the meantime, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-low heat in a large skillet. Add the onions and sauté, stirring every once in a while, until soft and caramelized, about 30 minutes.\n    \n*   Remove the meat from the oven, and add the ketchup, sugar, paprika, smoked paprika, cayenne, thyme or rosemary, and bay leaves to the pan. Using a fork, whisk everything together with the beef stock. Arrange the caramelized onions on top of the meat. Cover the pan again with the lid or foil, and return it to the oven for 2-3 hours. NOTE: if you want to be able to cut the brisket into slices, take it out at 2 hours. If you want it to be falling apart, more along the lines of a pulled brisket, keep it in for the full 3.\n    \n*   Remove the meat from the oven, and transfer it to a cutting board. Slice the brisket against the grain into slices. Return the meat to the sauce and serve, or store in the fridge overnight–the brisket can be made a day or two in advance.\n    \n\nIf your pan is big enough, you can add some potatoes or carrots during the cooking process at step 5, after you whisk in the sauce ingredients. Keep both in fairly large chunks so they don’t overcook.",
  "https://www.seriouseats.com/detroit-style-pizza-recipe": "\n\n> **Scraped from [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/detroit-style-pizza-recipe)**\n\n### Why It Works\n\n*   Using a high-hydration dough made with bread flour gives you pizza with a tender-yet-chewy, extra-crisp crust.\n*   Using a specialized Detroit-style pan aids in achieving superior crust development, thanks to its dark surfaces that promote even browning and heat conduction.\n*   Spreading cheese all the way to the edges of the pizza pan, before other toppings are added, lets it melt into the edges, forming a crisp, browned crust.\n\nFor the past year, I've been up to mY neck in crispy cheese crusts. That's not a bad place to be, mind you.\n\nWhen did Detroit pizza become a thing? I mean, I know that rectangular pan pizzas have been served in the Motor City since at least 1946, when, according to [PMQ Pizza Media](https://www.pmq.com/detroit-style-pizza-origin/), bar owner Gus Guerra and his wife, Anna, decided to throw a batch of her mother's Sicilian dough into a blue steel pan, originally used to carry auto parts, and bake it with cheese and sauce. The pizza emerged with a blackened, lacy, crispy cheese crust all the way around the edges, and a new pizza style was born. [Buddy's](https://www.buddyspizza.com/), the restaurant opened by the Guerras, has been serving it ever since.\n\nBut that's not what I mean. When did it become a _thing_? Starting in early 2016 or so, everyone seemed to be talking about it or writing about it or opening up restaurants devoted to it. I first became aware of it back in 2008, when former Serious Eats editor and current bar pie specialist Adam Kuban included it in [his exhaustive pizza style guide](https://www.seriouseats.com/a-list-of-regional-pizza-styles-slideshow), but it wasn't until the following year, during my annual Michigan hunting trip, that I tasted it for the first time, at a Buddy's in Detroit.  \n\nWhat Is Detroit-Style Pizza?\n----------------------------\n\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n\nTo be frank, I don't know why it didn't blow up earlier. The stuff is freaking delicious. Let's start from the bottom and work our way up: The crust comes out crisp and golden on the bottom, with a lightly fried texture that it gets from sizzling in the rendered fat that drips down from the cheese. Next, we move on to the crumb, which is chewy, with a medium-fine bubble structure. Not so rustic as, say, a focaccia, but not quite as soft and fluffy as a New York–style Sicilian slice.\n\nAbove that is where things get a little topsy-turvy. Instead of using the \"sauce, cheese, toppings\" order of a typical pizza, Detroit pizzas are built in reverse. Creamy, tangy brick cheese from Wisconsin is cubed and applied directly to the top of the dough, where it bakes up gooey, buttery, and thick in the middle, crispy and dark brown around the edges. On top of the cheese is a sweet, thick tomato sauce, seasoned with plenty of garlic and spices and often applied in heavy parallel bands. If you order the pizza with pepperoni (the most common topping), depending on where you are, you might find it cupped and crisp on top of the sauce, or, occasionally, buried underneath the cheese, where its flavor seeps in and penetrates every bite.\\* It's crispy, fatty, cheesy, tangy, and glorious, especially those coveted corner pieces that give you that extra crunch.\n\n_\\*Should we call them \"middlings\" instead of \"toppings\" if they're stuck in the middle?_\n\nThis is not everyday pizza. It's not every-week pizza. It might not even be every-month, if you want to live to a reasonable age. But damn, is it _good_ pizza. So good that it's worth a trip to Detroit just to taste it. So good that it's worth devoting months of time, weeks of research, and dozens and dozens of experiments to developing a recipe to duplicate it at home. So that's exactly what I did. Here's what I found.\n\nFinding the Perfect, Chewy Crust\n--------------------------------\n\nI decided to start my testing by focusing on the crust. For these tests, I used low-moisture mozzarella and a jar of Rao's for the sauce. Since I already have an easy [recipe for foolproof pan pizza](https://www.seriouseats.com/foolproof-pan-pizza-recipe), I started there, figuring I could tweak it to make it work for a Detroit pie. That recipe uses a basic no-knead method: Flour and water are combined with yeast (1% of the flour by weight) and salt (2.5% of the flour by weight) and mixed together in a bowl, just until a shaggy dough forms. The bowl is then covered and set aside overnight. During that overnight rest, yeast multiplies and produces bubbles of carbon dioxide that slowly expand and rise, in effect kneading the dough for you. In the morning, you wind up with a stretchy, relaxed dough with plenty of gluten development.\n\nA little too much gluten development, as it turned out.\n\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n\nGood gluten development and a nicely relaxed, high-moisture dough lead to a very rustic hole structure, with a hearty chew and a mix of big, small, and medium-sized bubbles. It's delicious, but Detroit pizza should be a little more uniform. Still, I liked the idea of a no-knead dough, so I tried it a few more times, using different ratios of flour to water. In baker-speak, this is known as \"hydration level\": A \"60% hydration dough\" is a dough that uses 60 grams of water for every 100 grams of flour. My original pan pizza has a hydration level of about 70%. I tried going down as low as 60%, which made a dough that had a finer hole structure (good!) but also a denser, tougher texture (bad!).\n\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n\nAfter a few more experiments (mostly around adding a fat to the dough, with the idea of making it a little more tender), I decided to throw in the towel on the no-knead method and switch to a more traditional kneading-based approach.\\*\\*\n\n_\\*\\* NB: No-knead is still a fantastic way to make pizza or bread if a rustic crumb is what you're after!_\n\nIn doing a bit more research, I found that [Adam Kuban had gone down a similar path](http://www.adamkuban.com/2013/02/detroit-style-pizza-75-hydration-all-purpose-flour/) years ago while exploring hydration levels in Detroit-style dough. According to him, using all-purpose flour and a super-high hydration level of 75% is the key. I mixed up another batch, this time using my stand mixer to make the dough. I started by combining the ingredients and mixing them just until they started to come together, then let them rest for 10 minutes before continuing to knead.  \n\nThis is a method called autolyse, during which an enzymatic breakdown of flour protein occurs,\\*\\*\\* making it easier to subsequently form gluten. Think of it sort of like converting a Lego spaceship into a castle: It's easiest if you break it down completely before starting to rebuild. Once the dough was kneaded, I let it rise for a couple hours at room temperature before turning it into a greased pan (more on that pan later). I let it rest once more to allow the gluten to relax, then stretched it out until it filled out the pan all the way to the edges, before topping and baking it in a hot oven.\n\n_\\*\\*\\* Technically, an autolyse is made before salt is added, but I've never really found a big difference between adding the salt at the start and adding it at the end._\n\nAdam is right that high hydration is a great way to go (though I ended up scaling my water back to around 73% instead of 75%), but I wasn't fully convinced about the all-purpose flour. Because all-purpose flour is relatively low in protein, it produces a light, very tender crumb that doesn't have quite the chew or pull I was looking for.\n\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n\nSwapping out that all-purpose flour for bread flour (I used King Arthur bread flour) was the real key, producing a crumb structure that was relatively open and chewy, but still squarely on the Detroit pizza end of the scale as opposed to the focaccia end.  \n\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n\nIn the past, [I've written glowingly about doughs made in a food processor](https://www.seriouseats.com/new-york-style-pizza), and I'm happy to report that this dough also works fabulously well in a food processor. Just dump the ingredients in, set the machine running until a ball of dough forms (that usually takes about 15 seconds), then let that ball of dough ride around the blade for 30 seconds longer. You'll be amazed at how quickly it develops an incredibly smooth, silky gluten structure. If you have a powerful food processor (our [review of the best food processors is right here](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-food-processor-equipment-review)) and are making only a couple batches of dough, it'll leave the stand mixer in the dust.\n\nFinding the Best Cheese and Pan\n-------------------------------\n\nWith the dough out of the way, I turned my attention to the cheese. Detroit pizza is unusual in two ways when it comes to cheese. The first is the use of brick cheese, a high-fat aged cheese from Wisconsin with a uniquely tangy, salty, buttery flavor that's hard to replace with alternatives. The second is the edges. If you've ever been to [Pequod's or Burt's Place in Chicago](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-deep-dish-pizza-in-chicago-5181624), or, better yet, had a pizza from [Windy City Pie](https://windycitypie.com/) in Seattle (incidentally, the best Chicago-style pan pizza I've ever had anywhere, including in Chicago), then you're familiar with the concept of a crispy, blackened cheese crust—the shelf of crisp, lacy cheese that surrounds the edge of the pizza. This is where the real magic of Detroit-style pizza lies, and, as I found out, getting it is not exactly straightforward.  \n\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n\nFor my testing, I ordered a ton of brick cheese from Amazon. If you order in bulk, it's relatively inexpensive, and worth it if authenticity is what you're after. (Don't worry; I also found some viable alternatives sold in supermarkets.) When I visited Dave Lichterman, the man behind Windy City Pie, in his Seattle kitchen a few months ago, he showed me how he makes his cheese crust. He starts by filling out a pan with dough, then lays overlapping _slices_ of cheese (not grated cheese!) on top, letting each one ride off the edge of the pan to line the sides, where they crisp and bake into shape.\n\nI tried that method with my Detroit-style pizza, but the problem was slicing the brick cheese—it's very soft, which makes slicing an almost impossible endeavor. Just for kicks, I tried using presliced supermarket cheeses of various flavors. None of them seemed to crisp up the way Dave's does.\n\nI wondered if the shape of the cheese wasn't the only issue. Up until now, I'd been cooking my pizza in standard aluminum rimmed baking sheets. Maybe there is some truth to what people say about those special Detroit pans being the secret ingredient in Detroit pizza?\n\nThe classic Detroit pizza pan is a deep, 10- by 14-inch rectangle of metal with black surfaces (for better conduction) and sides that flare gently away from the bottom. While the original pans were made from blue steel, most modern pans are made from anodized aluminum and come with a nonstick coating. I tested a number of these pans and found that yes, the black surfaces really did make a difference in how well that cheese crisped.\n\nThe best one I tried was from [LloydPans](https://lloydpans.com/detroit-style-pizza-pans.html). They've been making these pans since the '80s. This is a specialty item for sure, but once you try this recipe, I can guarantee that you'll be using it with regularity. Still, if you don't want a dedicated pizza pan, I found that you can get decent results from a pair of deep, well-seasoned or nonstick 8- by 8-inch cake pans.\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* _The crust doesn't come out quite as nice when you use a pair of cake pans, but you do end up with more of it because of the two extra edges, so it's a pretty fair trade._  \n\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n\nAfter stretching my dough, I added a layer of diced brick cheese, which I made sure to spread all the way to the very edges of the pan. Buddy's in Detroit claims that it uses a full pound of cheese for each pizza. I've seen some recipes that call for eight ounces or less. I ended up splitting the difference by adding 12 ounces of diced cheese. Don't get me wrong: It's still a _ton_\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* of cheese, but not so much that eating it becomes painful.\n\n_\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Not literally a ton._\n\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n\nYa see how nice that cheese-and-pan combo works out? For the record, the cheese crust may look black, but I can assure you that it does not taste burnt or bitter. I can't explain it.\n\nSwapping out that brick cheese for a different cheese turned out to be surprisingly difficult. Not only does brick cheese have its own flavor, it's also extremely high in fat, which is important. As that butterfat drips down into the pan, it fries directly into the crust. Many people note that Detroit pizza has a buttery flavor despite containing no butter at all; that flavor comes from the brick cheese fat.\n\nAt [Tony's Pizza Napoletana](http://tonyspizzanapoletana.com/) in San Francisco, owner and pizza savant Tony Gemignani uses cheddar around the edges. The cheddar comes out reasonably lacy and crisp, but the flavor reminds me more of a crisp-edged grilled cheese. I tried sliced and cubed low-moisture mozzarella and young, soft Jack. I even gave havarti a go. In the end, the closest substitute I could find was a 50/50 mix of low-moisture mozzarella (which provides some of that clean, buttery dairy flavor) and Jack (which has plenty of fat and also tanginess).\n\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n\nLike tuning into a _Bill Nye_ marathon when you're in the mood for _Mr. Wizard_, it's not quite the same, but it'll leave you mostly satisfied.\n\nSeasoning the Sauce\n-------------------\n\nCompared to the struggles I went through to nail the crust and cheese, the sauce was a piece of cake. Unlike a typically sparse Neapolitan- or New York–style pizza sauce, Detroit-style pizza sauces are usually heavily seasoned with aromatics. To make mine, I started by sautéing fresh garlic, a little pinch of pepper flakes, and a good amount of dried oregano in extra-virgin olive oil before adding tomatoes. I generally recommend using whole peeled tomatoes that you crush yourself by hand, as whole peeled tomatoes exhibit more consistency than other types of processed tomatoes. But in this case, without a food mill, it's hard to get the uniform crushed texture that you want in Detroit-style pizza sauce, so I opted for canned crushed tomatoes instead.\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* So long as you use a good-quality brand, like Muir Glen, Bianco DiNapoli, or Cento D.O.P. San Marzanos, crushed will do just fine.\n\n_\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Little CA-living brag here: The very best sauce I made was from the San Marzanos I grew and canned myself last summer. Thpbhbpbhpbphpbtbh._\n\nSome recipes call for canned pizza sauce or tomato paste. I find that both can dull flavor too much, so I prefer to simmer down my tomatoes until they're nicely reduced and intensely flavored.\n\nMy sauce was tasty, but it was still missing something. I'm generally a \"fresh garlic all the way\" type of guy, but I couldn't shake the feeling that granulated garlic powder might be that missing element. Turns out I was right.\n\nAdding a small dash of granulated garlic and granulated onion, along with a bit of sugar, was the key. Now, I know from experience how uncomfortable people can get about [sugar in their tomato sauce](https://www.seriouseats.com/new-york-style-pizza-sauce), so I'll tell you right now: I don't care. If putting sugar in tomato sauce offends you, by all means, keep it sugar-free. I promise I won't stop you. Meanwhile, I'll be over here, eating my delicious pizza, and no, you can't have any.  \n\nThere's a school of thought that suggests waiting to add sauce to a Detroit pizza until _after_ it comes out of the oven. That's not a bad way to do it, but I prefer the cosmic oneness that the pizza achieves when the cheese and sauce are cooked together.\n\nToppings and Baking\n-------------------\n\nThe only thing left to address is how to add toppings and bake this thing. You can feel free to use whatever toppings you personally like, but to my mind, pepperoni is the only real choice here.\n\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n\nI mentioned before that some restaurants like to place the pepperoni under the cheese, while others place it on top. I really do like the way the flavor gets integrated into the dough when you place the pepperoni underneath, but giving up those crisp, charred edges from [pepperoni cooked on top of the pie](https://www.seriouseats.com/spicy-spring-sicilian-pizza-recipe) physically pains me, so I thought: Por que no los dos?  \n\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n\nLaying pepperoni out under _and_ over the pie gives you the best of both worlds. Incidentally, make sure to use a high-quality natural-casing pepperoni, like Vermont Smoke & Cure, or even Boar's Head (the stick version, _not_ the presliced!). That's how you guarantee that your pepperoni will cup up into those crispy little grease chalices that Adam Kuban is so fond of.\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n_\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* You can read up a bit on the fascinating [science of what makes pepperoni curl](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-pizza-lab-why-does-pepperoni-curl) right here._\n\nThe only thing left to test was baking, and, unfortunately, here's where things get a wee bit hairy. The problem is that ovens are not very accurate, or even uniform. Most ovens tend to heat more from the bottom than from the top, but some are the opposite. Some ovens maintain a steady temperature, while others fluctuate wildly up and down.\n\nI have a few pieces of advice here. First, set the oven as hot as it will get. In a home oven, that's 500 to 550°F (260 to 290°C). At those temperatures, you get good browning and crisping of the crust before the dough has a chance to dry out too much. But even then, you might find that the top of your pizza ends up cooking before the bottom does. If you know that your oven doesn't heat much from the bottom, or if you make the recipe and find the base is not quite as crisp as you like, you have a couple options.\n\nFirst is to place the pan on top of a preheated [Baking Steel](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-pizza-lab-the-baking-steel-delivers), which will help pump heat into the base of the pizza, where it's needed most. Your second option is to place the pizza directly on the floor of a preheated oven, which will also give it a nice, quick energy boost.  \n\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n\nIn a hot oven, the pizza cooks in about 12 to 15 minutes. You'll know it's done when the cheese around the edges is sizzling and black and the top is very lightly browned.  \n\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n\nOnce it comes out of the oven, use a thin metal spatula to carefully prise the edges away from the pan, giving the whole thing a few shakes until it seems to move around freely.  \n\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n\nFrom there, transfer the pizza to a cutting board, and do your best not to immediately plant your face in it. That's rude. And also liable to give you severe burns on your eyeballs. That's something nobody likes.  \n\nYou know what's something that _everybody_ likes? Delicious pizza. Like the one you're going to make this week.  \n\nSerious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n\nI mean, just look at that crumb. Oh, oh! And let me show you the best part:  \n\nSerious Eats / J.

Welcome to Detroit, my friends.  \n\n### February 2017\n\nKeep Screen Awake\n\nFor the Dough:\n\n*   300 g bread flour (10.5 ounces; about 2 generous cups)\n    \n*   5 g instant yeast (0.15 ounce; about 1 teaspoon), such as SAF Instant Yeast\n    \n*   9 g salt (0.3 ounce; about 1 1/2 teaspoons table salt or 1 tablespoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt)\n    \n*   220 g water (7.75 ounces; about 1 cup minus 1 1/2 teaspoons)\n    \n*   Extra-virgin olive oil, as needed\n    \n\nFor the Sauce:\n\n*   2 tablespoons (30 ml) extra-virgin olive oil\n    \n*   3 medium cloves garlic, minced\n    \n*   2 teaspoons (about 5 g) dried oregano\n    \n*   Dash red pepper flakes\n    \n*   1 (28-ounce; 800 g) can high-quality crushed tomatoes\n    \n*   1 teaspoon (about 6 g) granulated garlic powder\n    \n*   1 teaspoon (about 6 g) granulated onion powder\n    \n*   1 tablespoon (about 15 g) sugar\n    \n*   Kosher salt, to taste\n    \n\nTo Finish:\n\n*   12 ounces (340 g) brick cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (see notes)\n    \n*   12 ounces (340 g) high-quality natural-casing pepperoni, such as Boar's Head or Vermont Smoke & Cure, cut into 1/8-inch slices (optional)\n    \n\n1.  **To Make the Dough in a Stand Mixer:** Combine flour, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Stir to combine, then add water. Mix on low speed until dough comes together into a rough ball, then shut off mixer and let rest for 10 minutes. Continue mixing at medium-low speed until dough forms a smooth, silky ball, about 10 minutes longer. (It should stick to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads rather than riding around the edges.) Remove dough hook, form dough into a tight ball, set in the bottom of the mixer bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.\n    \n    Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n    \n2.  **To Make the Dough in a Food Processor:** Combine flour, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine. Add water, then turn on processor and process until dough forms a ball that rides around the bowl of the processor, about 30 seconds. Continue processing for 30 seconds longer. Transfer dough to a bowl, form a tight ball, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.\n    \n3.  **To Make the Dough by Hand:** Combine flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk to combine, then add water and stir with a wooden spoon until a rough ball of dough has formed. Set aside for 10 minutes. Turn dough out onto a countertop and knead until a smooth, silky ball has formed, about 10 minutes. Transfer dough to a bowl, form a tight ball, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place until dough has roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.\n    \n4.  Pour a couple tablespoons olive oil in the bottom of a Detroit-style anodized aluminum pan or two 8- by 8-inch cake pans. (Split dough in half if using cake pans.) Transfer dough to pan(s) and turn to coat in oil. Press down on dough and spread it toward the edges. You won't be able to get it all the way to the edges; this is okay. Spread it as much as you can without tearing, then cover tightly in plastic and set aside for 30 minutes to allow dough to relax. Return to dough and stretch it out again. It should be able to reach the edges this time. If not, let it rest a little more and try again. To get the dough to stay in the corners, stretch it up beyond the corners so that it pulls back into place. Once dough is stretched, cover again and set aside while you make the sauce.\n    \n    Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n    \n5.  **For the Sauce:** Adjust oven rack to lowest position and preheat oven to 550°F (290°C), or as close to it as your oven gets. Heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat until shimmering. Add minced garlic, oregano, and pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add tomatoes, garlic powder, onion powder, and sugar. Bring to a simmer and cook until reduced to about 3 cups, about 30 minutes. Season to taste with salt.\n    \n    Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n    \n6.  **To Form the Pizza:** Press down on dough with your fingertips to remove any large air bubbles. Lay half of pepperoni (if using) evenly over face of dough. Top with cheese, spreading it evenly all the way to the very edges of the pan, then add remaining pepperoni. Spoon sauce over surface in 3 even rows. (You will need only about half the sauce—save the rest for another pizza.)\n    \n    Serious Eats / J. Kenji López-Alt\n    \n7.  Transfer to oven and bake until edges are black and bubbly and exposed cheese on top is starting to lightly brown, 12 to 15 minutes. (If your oven doesn't cook well from the bottom, consider placing the pizza directly on the oven floor.) Transfer to a trivet or folded kitchen towel on countertop.\n    \n    Serious Eats / J.

Yaki Udon recipes are basically made with a choice of protein, vegetables, and thick chewy udon noodles.\n\nCooking method is very similar to other stir fry udon noodles recipes. I've already shared my [Yaki Udon with Chicken](https://khinskitchen.com/udon-stir-fry/) and [Prawn Noodles](https://khinskitchen.com/shanghai-noodles-with-prawns/) recipes a few months back, for my friends who want to make it with chicken or prawns.\n\nJump to:\n\n*   [Ingredients you will need](#ingredients-you-will-need)\n*   [How to make beef udon stir fry](#how-to-make-beef-udon-stir-fry)\n*   [Variations and substitutes](#variations-and-substitutes)\n*   [Cooking tips](#cooking-tips)\n*   [Frequently asked questions](#frequently-asked-questions)\n*   [📖 Recipe](#%f0%9f%93%96-recipe)\n*   [💬 Reviews](#comments)\n\nIngredients you will need\n-------------------------\n\nThis is a very straightforward recipe, you will only need 4 basic ingredients. Beefsteak, udon noodles, a choice of stir fry vegetables, and quick homemade stir fry sauce. Most of the sauce ingredients are pantry staples, except **Japanese cooking wine**.\n\n![Labelled ingredients for udon beef stir fry, placed on the white table.](https://khinskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ingredients-for-beef-udon-stir-fry.jpg)\n\n*   **Beef:** Use beef steak like, ribeye, sirloin, tenderloin, rump, or any of your favourite tender steak cut.\n*   **Noodles:** Udon is a thick chewy Japanese wheat noodles. You can buy staright-to-wok udon at most supermarket Asian aisle or fresh/frozen udon at Oriental Chinese and Korean grocery stores.\n*   **Vegetables:** I add pak choi, mushroom, and onion in this recipe. Pak choi is widely available in UK supermarkets and groceries.\n*   **Stir Fry Sauce:** Japanese mirin, light soy sauce and sugar are 3 key sauces to make the sauce. I add dark soy sauce for more colour and sesame oil to bring some toasty flavour. A dash of cornstarch is to thicken the sauce.\n\n![Labelled ingredients of stir fry udon sauce, displayed on the white table.](https://khinskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ingredients-for-beef-udon-stir-fry-1.jpg)\n\nSee the recipe card for detailed quantities.\n\nHow to make beef udon stir fry\n------------------------------\n\n*   First blanch the udon noodles with hot boiling for 1-2 minutes to loosen up. Drain water out, rinse with cold water and set it aside.\n\n![Two image collage showing how to prepare udon noodles.](https://khinskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/beef-udon-stir-fry-process-3.jpg)\n\n*   Gather all ingredients, cut the meat and vegetables.

Add garlic, onion, and stir for 1 minute. Follow with the mushroom and cook for another 1 minute. Next add the pak choi and stir it well for few seconds.\n*   Place the udon in the middle of the pan, pour the sauce in. Toss well, continue cook for another 1-2 minutes, until sauce and everything combine evenly.\n*   Turn off the heat and sprinkle chopped spring onions.\n\n![Six image collage showing how to cook beef udon stir fry. ](https://khinskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/beef-udon-stir-fry-process-2.jpg)\n\nVariations and substitutes\n--------------------------\n\n*   **Udon** \\- instead of ready-to-fry udon, you can use other noodles like Shanghai, Hokkien, or any thick egg/wheat noodles. Even ramen or yakisoba noodles goes well with this recipe too.\n*   **Pak Choi** - it can be substitute with bok choy, choy sum, kai lan, or your choice of stir fry vegetables.\n*   **Add-ons** \\- other stir fry vegetables like bell pepper, snap peas, carrots, baby corns, cabbage, etc, goes well with this dish. Japanese red picked ginger gives fresh taste to the dish too. If you have it in hand you can add this as a toppings or garnish.\n*   **Steak** - Instead of tender steak, you can swap with chicken, pork, or prawns. For vegetarians, swap with firm tofu or Quorn meat.\n*   **Mirin -** Japanese mirin has a unique taste and flavour but if you cannot get it, use Chinese cooking wine or dry sherry instead. For non-alcochol version, substitute mirin with rice vinegar and a dash of sugar for some sweetness.\n*   **Chilli** \\- Authentic Japanese yaki udon dishes are mild flavour in general. If you love to bring some heat to the dish, add some fresh chilli pepper slices in the stir fry or a tablespon of chilli oil in the sauce mixture. See my homemade [chilli garlic oil](https://khinskitchen.com/homemade-chilli-oil/) on my website.\n\n![A pan containing stir fry beef, udon noodles, mushroom, green vegetables, and wooden spoon in the background. ](https://khinskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/beef-udon-stir-fry-4.jpg)\n\nCooking tips\n------------\n\n1.  **Cut the steak against the grain** for tender result. If you are using cheaper cuts like chuck or flank steak, add a teaspoon of corn starch and half teaspoon of baking soda, together with a tablespoon of stir fry sauce. Let it sit aside and marinade for 15 minutes. This is the simple trick to keep the meat moist and tender in your fry dishes.\n2.  You can **blanch the udon noodles** with hot water or prepare by the packet instructions but it's important not to overcook them. Rinse with cold water and drain the water out after boiling/blanching.\n3.  **Use large pan** or wok to give enough heat to all ingredients evenly.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n--------------------------\n\n**What are udon noodles made of?**\n\nUdon is made with wheat flour and water. One of the very few types of Asian noodles that doesn't contain egg inside. Soft, thick, chewy in texture and you can add in your stir fry and soups.\n\n**What does Beef Udon Stir Fry taste like?**\n\nBeef Udon has a sweet and savoury taste made with soy sauces, sugar and Japanese mirin. Loaded with juicy tender beef steak, crisp vegetables and thick chewy udon noodles. Very light, filling and satisfying noodle dish that both kids and adults can enjoy.\n\n### More Delicious Noodle Recipes\n\n*   [\n    \n    Easy Chicken Yaki Udon\n    \n    ](https://khinskitchen.com/udon-stir-fry/)\n*   [\n    \n    Yakisoba Recipe ( Stir Fried Japanese Noodles )\n    \n    ](https://khinskitchen.com/yakisoba-stir-fried-japanese-noodles/)\n*   [\n    \n    Chicken Broccoli Noodles\n    \n    ](https://khinskitchen.com/chicken-broccoli-noodles/)\n*   [\n    \n    Easy Beef Chow Mein\n    \n    ](https://khinskitchen.com/easy-beef-chow-mein/)\n\n### Stay updated on new recipes:\n\nWe are on social media [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/khinskitchen), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/khinskitchen/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/KhinsKitchen) ( New recipe video every week ) and [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/khinskitchen/_created/) ( Pin your favourite recipes ).

Drain and rinse with cold water and set it aside. ( Or prepare by the packet instructions. Make sure not to overcooked as you are stir frying them again. )\n    \n*   Mix all the sauce ingredients in a bowl, whisk and set it aside. Cut the beef into thin slices against the grain. Season with 1 tablespoon of stir fry sauce mix. Gather and prepare the vegetables.\n    \n*   Heat the large pan or wok to medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoon of oil, stir fry the beef slices for 2-3 minutes. Push the beef to one side, add garlic and onion slices and stir for few seconds and follow with the mushroom. Cook for another 1 minute, then add the pak choi and toss it well.\n    \n*   next place the udon in the middle of the pan, pour the sauce mixture in. Cook for another 2 minutes until the sauce and other ingredients combine evenly.\n    \n*   Turn off the heat and sprinkle chopped spring onions. Transfer to serving plate and serve immediately.\n    \n\n*   **Udon Noodles -** If you use pre-cooked or ready-to-use udon noodles, add hot boiling water over the noodles let it sit for 1-2 minutes. Then rinse with cold water. If you use fresh or frozen noodles, follow the packet instructions. To prevent the noodles from overcooked, rinse with cold water after boiling.   \n    Instead of udon, you can swap with any thick egg or wheat noodles. \n*   **Steak -** Use chicken, prawns/shrimp, or pork instead of beef steak. \n*   **Vegetables -** Other stir fry vegetables can be added or substituted. If you use hard vegetables like broccoli or tender stem broccoli, blanch them in hot water for few minutes before adding to stir fry.\n*   **Mirin -** Mirin is a Japanese sweet cooking rice wine, similar to sake. If you cannot get mirin, substitute with Chinese Shaoxing wine or dry sherry. For halal or non-alcohol cooking, you can use rice vinegar and a dash of sugar as substitutes. \n*   **Salt & Pepper -** As soy sauces already consist of salt intake, we don't usually add salt in this recipe. But you can make a taste test and add some salt or black pepper according to your taste. \n*   **Adjust sugar -** If you prefer your sauce sweeter, add extra sugar or adjust to your preference. \n\nCalories: 709kcal | Carbohydrates: 121g | Protein: 32g | Fat: 16g | Saturated Fat: 8g | Polyunsaturated Fat: 1g | Monounsaturated Fat: 2g | Sodium: 2730mg | Potassium: 1827mg | Fiber: 15g | Sugar: 30g | Vitamin A: 25796IU | Vitamin C: 269mg | Calcium: 619mg | Iron: 5mg\n\nReader Interactions\n-------------------",

Step\n    \n    1\n    \n    Prepare a marinade for the chicken. Combine the lemon juice, ½ cup olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, turmeric, cinnamon and crushed red pepper in a large bowl, then whisk to combine.

Chill for 4-5 hours.  \n• Marinade meat overnight & cooked with peppers & onions. F  \ninish with broil for 2-3 minutes  \n• Serve with tortillas instead of pita + sliced cucumbers & tomatoes + feta. (Hummus is overkill side)  \n• Serve with chickpeas salad (olives, tomatoes, red onion, parsley/basil)\n\nI've lost track of how many times I've made this amazing dish since I first cut it out; there's some in the fridge right now. I have made the following additions: more onion - it's so good. More chicken - it goes so fast: 3 pounds. Two pounds of carrots, which I toss in the marinade and roast with the extra red onion. An astonishing recipe!\n\nTrim eggplant and cut it into long slices. Salt the slices and let them sit for 20 minutes or so, then pat them dry. Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towel and place a wire rack on top. In a large, deep skillet, heat 1/2 cup oil until a drop of water flicked into pan sizzles. Working in batches, fry eggplant until just tender, 20 to 30 seconds per side. Transfer fried eggplant to rack to drain. Nice with shawarma!\n\nGreat marinade!\n\nFinally made this tonight - followed recipe except used more onion. It is easy and DELICIOUS! Even my VERY finicky teen son devoured it. Served in pita with tzatziki, chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and the roasted onion.\n\nI fed 18 people with this recipe over the holidays. Used double the amount of red onion, but followed everything else. This recipe is a winner! Served it with pita, purchased tzatziki and the NYTimes Taverna salad minus the pita crisps-- delicious IN the pita with the chicken and roasted onion, or on the side. Thank you, NYTimes, for making it so easy for me to deliciously feed a crowd! Happy New Year to all.\n\nSorry, should've noted I tripled the recipe to feed 18 people!\n\nPrivate comments are only visible to you.",
  "https://smittenkitchen.com/2020/01/roasted-squash-and-tofu-with-ginger/": "\n\n> **Scraped from [smitten kitchen](https://smittenkitchen.com/2020/01/roasted-squash-and-tofu-with-ginger/)**\n\nI didn’t mean to disappear on you. I’d intended to start the year with [soup](https://smittenkitchen.com/recipes/soup/?format=photo), as I always do. I made a lovely-but-not-lovely-enough winter minestrone and then a red lentil situation but neither really seemed spotlight worthy and it can be hard sometimes but I really don’t want to publish anything here I don’t want to sing from the rooftops about. All of our time is worth more than that. While I was debating my next soup move, my friend texted and said “Can u believe the wedding is two weeks away??” and I bolted straight up in bed because, well, no. I could not believe it at all. I mean, I knew I’d told her I’d make her wedding cake. We’d discussed the headcount and flavors they liked. I had a loose idea of it in my mind and looked forward to really getting started on it… in a couple weeks. Needless to say, this is where the rest of January went and I’m going to tell you all about it next week — it’s going through some rigorous retesting and is going to be worth the wait because it’s probably one of the most delicious cakes I have ever made. But still, let’s never go on a break again.\n\n  \n[![a kabocha squash](https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/49450571066_6dd78a7ac9_n.jpg?resize=320%2C213&ssl=1)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/49450571066/in/photostream \"a kabocha squash\")[![scooped out](https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/49450797862_ec52aa6925_n.jpg?resize=320%2C213&ssl=1)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/49450797862/in/photostream \"scooped out\")![thin wedges](https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/49450570036_8348177508_n.jpg?resize=320%2C213&ssl=1)[![a few things you'll need](https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/49450086698_12e44190b9_n.jpg?resize=320%2C213&ssl=1)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/49450086698/in/photostream \"a few things you'll need\")[![whisked marinade](https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/49450086323_73d724824c_n.jpg?resize=320%2C213&ssl=1)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/49450086323/in/photostream \"whisked marinade\")[![ready to bake](https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/49450796497_3c25cc6c3c_n.jpg?resize=320%2C213&ssl=1)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/49450796497/in/photostream \"ready to bake\")\n\nThe other kind of thing you miss very much when you’re three Kitchen Aid bowls deep in buttercream is vegetables, especially those coated in salt, acid, and heat. and I received the wonderful Diana Henry’s (she of the [Bird in Hand](https://amzn.to/37y9wlo) and [How to Eat a Peach](https://amzn.to/38L7BKq) fame for highly cookable recipes) most recent cookbook, [From the Oven to the Table](https://amzn.to/2RwP13d), full of sheet pan-ish meals, last fall and my favorite thing happened: I immediately bookmarked four dishes. This is what we always hope will, that we’ll instantly shake off a cooking rut we may not even have realized we were in at the suggestion of something new. I made the salsiccia con patate e pomodoro (wonderful), melting baked onions (I think I undercooked them but the potential is definitely there), toad in a hole with leeks and cheddar (soon!), a Persian-spiced spatchcooked chicken (ditto), and now this.\n\n[![from the oven](https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/49450796212_e2e6a3c7f7_z.jpg?resize=640%2C427&ssl=1)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smitten/49450796212/in/photostream \"from the oven\")\n\nThis is fantastic. I’ve never combined tofu and winter squash before but it was my loss. Both are coated with a soy sauce-honey-ginger mixture plus chile flakes to taste and roasted halfway, and then you spoon a lot of garlic oil over, so it gets toasty in the second half of cooking but doesn’t burn. When it comes out of the oven, you scatter it with a three-fer of sesame seeds, scallions, and lime juice and you guys, my 10-year old asked for leftovers of this in his lunchbox today.

Nevertheless, I tried to squeeze this onto one large (half-sheet) pan vs. the two baking dishes she suggests in the book and my tofu didn’t come out very crisp. If this doesn’t bother you, squeeze away.\n\nPlease read: To ensure this recipe is gluten-free, use soy sauce or tamari labeled clearly labeled as gluten-free. To make this dish vegan, use sugar or another sweetener instead of honey.\n\n*   14-ounce package extra-firm tofu\n*   2 pounds winter squash (such as kabocha or acorn)\n*   3 tablespoons honey or brown sugar (see Note)\n*   1/3 cup soy sauce (see Note)\n*   1/2 to 2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste\n*   1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated\n*   7 tablespoons vegetable or peanut oil, divided\n*   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n*   6 garlic cloves, very thinly sliced\n*   1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds\n*   2 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced on the diagonal\n*   Juice of half a lime\n\n**Drain your tofu and remove as much water as you can:** There are two easy ways to ensure your tofu gets as crisp as possible, but the first requires advanced planning. 1. The first is one that a [dear reader](https://smittenkitchen.com/2019/08/black-pepper-tofu-and-eggplant/#comment-1438871) has been pressing (get it? sorry) me/us to try for years: [freezing it](https://food52.com/blog/16714-a-pretty-cool-shortcut-for-firmer-more-flavorful-tofu). You can freeze your tofu as soon as you get it home, still in the package, or already drained. Once defrosted, it easily shakes off all of its water (you’ll want to blot it though) and even has a lovely texture. But, this requires a little more planning. 2. The second is a little faster, but some say less effective: place your block of on a few layers of paper towel with more towels over it (and even a tray or plate on top to weight it) and to set aside for 5 minutes, or until needed.\n\n**Heat your oven:** To 400°F. Cover 1 to 2 baking sheets with parchment paper for easy cleanup.\n\n**Prepare tofu and vegetables:** Cut tofu into 1/2-inch slices, and then in half again. Halve and seed your squash — I like to remove the seeds with a metal soup spoon, which makes it much easier to get it clean. Cut squash into 1/2 to 3/4-inch thick wedges. If using two pans, you can arrange the squash on one and the tofu on another. If using one, try to puzzle them together as I do above; it will be more snug.\n\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the honey or sugar, soy sauce, pepper flakes (to taste), ginger, and 4 tablespoons of the oil. If using two pans, pour 2/3 of the marinade over the squash and 1/3 over the tofu, and turn each slice of squash over gently to coat on both sides. If using only one, use all the marinade, coating the squash and tofu together. In all cases, season the squash and tofu with salt and pepper.\n\n**Cook:** Roast for 15 minutes, then using a thin metal spatula ([this](https://amzn.to/2TvX4fW) is my favorite), turn the squash and tofu chunks over. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 3 tablespoons oil with the garlic and spoon this all over the squash and tofu. Return pan(s) to the oven and roast until the tofu is dark and the squash is completely tender, 10 to 15 more minutes.\n\n**Serve:** Directly from the pan(s) or arranged on a serving plate. Scatter with sesame seeds and scallions, and squeeze lime juice over.\n\nPost navigation\n---------------",

And to make up for the inherent blandness of the cooking method, she slathers them with a rich tahini butter spiked with soy sauce, which immediately melts into a mouth-smacking sauce. Her simple recipe ends with a shower of golden sesame seeds and a torrent of lime juice.

Eating this recipe weekly is part of the secret to my success!\n\nWe frequently eat baked sweet potatoes that are wrapped in foil paper. This time I baked one in the oven in foil paper and steamed one. The steamed one was tasted bland; the baked one was deliciously sweet. The tahini butter was a nice touch, but was unnecessary with the baked one. I'll stay with baking.\n\nThis is one of the BEST recipes I've come across on here. It's delicious. I've made it several times in the past few weeks at the request of friends and family. And I've been asked to share the recipe several times as well. Delicious with Japanese yams, and works great if subbing tamari for soy, too. Definitely a winner! Full disclosure: I cooked my sweet potatoes in the microwave, because I'm often short on time and also I'm a complete heathen.\n\nThe tahini sauce is good enough to want to eat with a spoon! But I just don't love sweet potatoes. I'll definitely try the sauce on other veggies, though. Maybe fish, too. Or there's that spoon, too...\n\nAccidentally over softened the butter today - it mixed so easily! And I just popped the whole thing in the fridge to get it back to a more solid . I always make a double batch of this tahini butter because it goes on everything especially dark greens. And keeps beautifully in the fridge.\n\nMeh, this probably won't be a repeat for me. I love all the constituent ingredients, I just wasn't wowed. For starters, I think the texture of the sweet potato skin is far worse when steamed rather than baked -- soft and kind of rubbery rather than caramelized. And while tahini, butter, lime and soy sauce taste good together (kind of a peanut sauce variation), I feel like there are better things to eat with a sweet potato (honestly just good quality butter and a sprinkle of salt is my favorite).\n\nPrivate comments are only visible to you.\n\n* * *\n\nor to save this recipe.\n\n* * *",
  "https://www.themediterraneandish.com/tahdig-recipe-crispy-persian-rice/": "\n\n> **Scraped from [The Mediterranean Dish](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/tahdig-recipe-crispy-persian-rice/)**\n\nHave you ever wanted to make Tahdig Persian Rice with that perfectly crispy golden crust? This recipe and step-by-step tutorial is all you need! And I have lots of ideas for what to serve along! \n\n![Persian rice tahdig, garnished with dried cherries and pistachios](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tahdig-persian-rice-recipe-8.jpg)\n\nTahdig has been on my list to make for while. And I’m happy to report it is easier to make than I thought! And if you ever wanted an impressive and unique dish for a special dinner, this Persian style rice with golden crust will not disappoint.\n\nI adapted and simplified a recipe from Eden Grinspahn’s cookbook Eating Out Loud, and once you try this easy Persian rice recipe you will come back for more!\n\n**What is tahdig**?\n-------------------\n\nTahdig, pronounced tah-deeg, literally means “bottom of the pot” in Persian/Farsi. And it refers to a beautiful, pan-fried Persian rice that is fluffy and buttery on the inside with a perfectly golden crust, which is the layer at the bottom of the pot. It’s beautifully laced with saffron and often scented with orange zest like in today’s recipe.\n\nIn her new book [Eating Out Loud](https://amzn.to/3d9d69b) (affiliate link), Eden describes making tahdig this way:\n\nYou’re basically building a rice “cake” with layers of rice, yogurt, and butter. It gets cooked in a tightly covered pan, where the steam cooks the rice while the outside crisps. Then it’s turned upside down out of the pan on a platter, where–if you’ve done your job right–the crispy outside bits hold the moist inside like a mold.\n\n**Tip: Don’t be a hero, use a nonstick pot. Makes all the difference**!\n\n![Tahdig Persian crispy rice with saffron ](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tahdig-persian-rice-recipe-7.jpg)\n\n**What kind of rice to use for Persian rice?**\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe kind of rice used is important. My Iranian friends only use [Basmati rice](https://amzn.to/3iE030W) (affiliate) for this recipe and all their Persian rice dishes, including [Adas Polo](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/adas-polo-rice-and-lentils-recipe/), with lentils and raisins, and [Baghali Polo](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/baghali-polo-persian-dill-rice-with-fava-beans/), with fava beans and fresh dill.\n\nTwo steps to prepare the rice for this tahdig recipe:\n\n*   **Wash the basmati rice very well under cold running water until the water runs clear**. Some folks even soak it for a bit, but that is not required today.\n*   **Par-boil the rice.** You’ll boil the rice with plenty of water and cook to al dante for 5 minutes or so before you assemble and make the tahdig.\n\n**The crust**\n-------------\n\nThe crust is where it’s at! It’s what makes this Persian rice recipe extra special.\n\nWhat makes the crust? There are different tahdig variations when it comes to acheiving that perfectly crispy, golden crust. Some use a layer of flat lavash bread at the bottom of the pot, while other recipes may use a layer of thinly sliced potatoes. But it’s the third method I wanted to try…\n\n**In this recipe, the curst is made of a mixture of rice, whole milk yogurt, and saffron.** The extra fat from just two tablespoons of whole milk yogurt really helps the bottom layer of rice crisp up nicely, while the above layer of rice gets steamed to fluffy perfection.\n\n![ingredients for persian rice tahdig](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tahdig-persian-rice-recipe-1.jpg)\n\n**How to make tahdig: step-by-step**\n------------------------------------\n\n**(print-friendly recipe with ingredient list below)**\n\n*   **Soak the saffron.** 1 teaspoon of saffron goes in 1 cup of super warm water (but not hot). Leave it be for at least 10 minutes. It’s important to give the saffron enough time in the water to bloom and release it’s beautiful color, so that’s why I start with this step.\n*   **Wash the rice and boil the rice.** Like I mentioned earlier, you’ll want to wash 2 cups basmati rice so well until the water runs clean. Then combine the rice with 8 cups of water and a good pinch of salt (the original recipe calls for 2 tablespoons as this is your only shot to season the rice itself, but I used 1 tablespoon). Boil for about 5 to 6 minutes, then drain well.\n*   **Prepare the rice, yogurt, saffron mixture.** Take 1 cup of the rice and mix it super well with 2 tablespoons of yogurt, 2 tablespoons of grapeseed oil (or another neutral-tasting oil) and 2 tablespoons of the saffron water.\n\n![basmati rice mixed with yogurt and saffron water](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tahdig-persian-rice-recipe-2.jpg)\n\n*   **Assemble the tahdig in a nonstick pot.** Spread the rice-yogurt mixture in bottom of the pot (this is what makes the crust). Use a 10-inch lidded nonstick pot here. Add 1 cup of the remaining rice on top, then 2 tablespoons of dried cherries, a little orange zest, and a pinch of cinnamon. Continue layering in this way until you have used up the rice (keep some of the dried cherries for garnish later). Dot the top layer o rice with the butter (the original recipe called for 8 tablespoons of butter, cubed, but for us 4 to 5 tablespoons was sufficient). Pour the rest of the saffron water on top.\n\n![rice layered with orange zest, cinnamon and dried cherries and butter.  ready to cook ](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tahdig-persian-rice-recipe-5.jpg)\n\n*   **Cook the tahdig.** To really trap the steam, do as my Persian friends do, wrap the lid of the pot in a thin kitchen towel. Use a rubber band to secure the towel around the handle (a little safety measure). Cover the pot and cook over low heat, 25 to 30 minutes or until the rice around the edges is golden and crispy (mine took more like 50 minutes for the bottom layer to fully crisp up and fully develop the golden color you see. I also ended up raising the heat a little bit to medium-low for a bit). Keep an eye and peek under the lid to make sure the bottom layer crisps nicely but does not burn (this is really all the TLC you need to do and it makes a difference).\n*   **Flip the cooked tahdig over and serve.** Remove the lid from the cooking pot and invert a large serving platter over the pot and carefully flip the pot over (the bottom crispy layer will now be on top). Although the nonstick pot helps a ton, don’t worry if some of the rice sticks to the bottom, just help it with a wooden spoon and run with it! Garnish with dried cherries and pistachios. Serve!\n\n![tahdig served with dried cherries and pistachios for garnish](https://www.themediterraneandish.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/tahdig-persian-rice-recipe-6.jpg)\n\n*   **Serve.** Remove the lid, invert a large serving plate over the pot, and carefully flip them over together. No worries if it sticks, just scrape it out and run with it! Sprinkle the tahdig with the reserved dried cherries and pistachios and serve right away.\n\n**What to serve with tahdig?**\n------------------------------\n\nThis crispy saffron rice can elevate any number of entrees.

Mix thoroughly.\n    \n*   Spread the rice-yogurt mixture evenly on the bottom of a 10-inch lidded nonstick pot. Sprinkle 1 cup of the remaining cooked rice on top, followed by 2 tablespoons of the dried cherries, a pinch of orange zest, and a pinch of cinnamon. Add another layer of rice and repeat with the cherries, orange zest, and cinnamon, reserving a couple tbsp of the cherries for garnish. As you go about layering, the rice will start to dome and look \"pointy\" in the middle--that's okay! Keep it that way. Finish by dotting the top with the butter and pour the rest of the saffron water all over the top.\n    \n*   Wrap the lid in a kitchen towel and secure it around the handle with a rubber band. Cover the pot and cook over low heat, 25 to 30 minutes or until the rice around the edges is golden and crispy; it's okay to peek under the lid! (See note #2) Be sure not to burn the bottom layer of the rice, though you do want a nice crust in the bottom.\n    \n*   Remove the lid, invert a large serving plate over the pot, and carefully flip them over together. No worries if it sticks, just scrape it out and run with it! Sprinkle the tahdig with the reserved dried cherries and pistachios and serve right away.\n    \n\n*   This recipe is adapted from [Eating Out Loud](https://amzn.to/3d9d69b) (affiliate link) by Eden Grinchpan.\n*   I used [Royal Basmati Rice](https://amzn.to/3iE030W) (affiliate link) \n*   **Note #1--butter amount:** The original recipe indicates 8 tablespoons (or 1 stick) unsalted butter. For me, 4 to 5 tablespoons were sufficient. \n*   **Note #2--how long until the bottom layer of rice crisps will vary.** My rice took 50 minutes for the bottom layer to crisp, and I did adjust the heat later to medium-low. It's important to keep an eye on the rice and peek under the lid occasionally to make sure the bottom crisps but does not burn. \n*   **Visit** [**our shop**](https://shop.themediterraneandish.com/) for quality Mediterranean products including extra virgin olive oils and spices. \n\nCalories: 314.7kcalCarbohydrates: 48.8gProtein: 5gSaturated Fat: 4.2gCholesterol: 15.3mgPotassium: 82mgFiber: 2.3gVitamin A: 727IUVitamin C: 0.2mgCalcium: 31.2mgIron: 0.7mg\n\nI’m Suzy; born and bred right on the shores of the Mediterranean.

I know these unassuming vegetables might not be the first ones you reach for at the farmers market or grocery store, but there are so many reasons to cook them. They’re nutritious and affordable. They’re colorful, and–best of all–they’re delicious.\n\nIn this roasted root vegetables recipe, I chop them into big chunks and toss them with olive oil, salt, pepper, and lots of fresh herbs. Then, I roast them until they’re tender and caramelized. When they come out of the oven, I drizzle them with a fragrant sage oil, which makes their rich, earthy flavor that much richer and that much earthier. And, as a final finishing touch, I sprinkle them with fried sage leaves, which offer a great crispy contrast to the tender roasted veg. You might not imagine yourself going back for a second helping of roasted root vegetables at a holiday dinner, but try this recipe, and I promise that you will.\n\n![Roasted root vegetables recipe ingredients](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0naHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmcnIHdpZHRoPScxMTYwJyBoZWlnaHQ9JzE3MDAnPjwvc3ZnPg==)\n\nRoasted Root Vegetables Recipe Ingredients\n------------------------------------------\n\nHere’s what you’ll need to make this roasted root vegetables recipe:\n\n*   **Root vegetables**, of course! I use red beets, golden beets, carrots, parsnips, sweet potatoes, and turnips. They fill this simple side dish with bold color and sweet, earthy, bitter, and nutty flavors.\n*   **Extra-virgin olive oil** – You’ll toss some with the veggies to help them become brown and tender in the oven and use more to make the infused sage oil.\n*   **Fresh herbs** – I roast the vegetables with chopped rosemary, sage, and thyme. I crisp up more whole sage leaves to use as a garnish on the final dish.\n*   **And salt and pepper** – To make all the flavors pop!\n\n_Find the complete recipe with measurements below._\n\n![Chopped beets, carrots, parsnips, sweet potatoes, and turnips on two baking sheets with olive oil and rosemary](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0naHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmcnIHdpZHRoPScxMTYwJyBoZWlnaHQ9JzE3MzknPjwvc3ZnPg==)\n\nRoasted Root Vegetables Recipe Tips\n-----------------------------------\n\n*   **To peel or not to peel? It’s up to you!** I haven’t indicated whether or not to peel the vegetables in the recipe below, because I think it’s a matter of personal preference. When I make this recipe, I typically peel the beets but leave the skins on the other root veggies, making sure to scrub them well before roasting. If you prefer, you can peel more or all of the vegetables. The recipe will come out great no matter what.\n*   **Group the veggies strategically.** The roasted vegetables are ready when their middles are tender and their outsides are nicely browned. But different types vegetables won’t all get to this point at the same time. For this reason, I recommend using two baking sheets in this recipe and grouping vegetables with similar cooking times together. Place the beets and carrots on one baking sheet and the sweet potatoes, parsnips, and turnips on the other. Start checking the vegetables after 25 minutes. You’ll likely take the pan with the sweet potatoes out of the oven well before you remove the one with the beets.\n*   **Don’t crowd the veggies.** Another benefit of using two baking sheets is that you’ll have plenty of room to spread out the veggies. If they’re crammed together, they’ll steam in the oven, softening without browning. For the best browning (aka the best flavor!), make sure to arrange the vegetables in a single layer on each pan.\n*   **Get ahead.** I recommend roasting the root vegetables on the day you plan to serve them, but they’re delicious warm or at room temp, so feel free to bake them off a few hours before your meal. Drizzle them with the sage oil and top them with the crispy sage leaves just before serving.\n\n![Roasted root vegetables with rosemary on two baking sheets](data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0naHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmcnIHdpZHRoPScxMTYwJyBoZWlnaHQ9JzE3MzknPjwvc3ZnPg==)\n\nHow to Serve Roasted Root Vegetables\n------------------------------------\n\nI developed this roasted veggies recipe with holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas in mind, but this healthy side dish would be at home at any fall or winter meal.
